00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:45,080
A light shines down on a [[storybook]]. It opens, and a voice turns the pages and reads it.

00:00:50,080 --> 00:01:45,200
CHARMING: Once upon a time in a kingdom far far away, the king and queen were blessed with a beautiful baby girl. And throughout the land, everyone was happy. Until the sun went down and they saw that their daughter was cursed with a frightful enchantment that took hold each and every night. Desperate they sought the help of a fairy godmother who had them lock the young princess away in a tower, there to await the kiss of the handsome prince charming! It was he who would chance the perilous journey through blistering cold and scorching desert traveling for many days and nights, risking life and limb to reach [[the Dragons Keep]].


Prince Charming arrives at the Dragon's Keep, an ominous castle surrounded by a moat of lava, but sees that the bridge leading across the lava is destroyed. Charming uses his bow to shoot a roped arrow to a wooden post on the other side and uses it as a zipline. He looks up at a tower that rises above the rest of the castle, a light shining from its window. He enters the Dragon's Keep.


00:01:48,280 --> 00:02:05,840
CHARMING: For he was the bravest... and most handsome... in all the land. And it was destiny that his kiss... would break the dreaded curse.

Charming continues through the abandoned castle and reaches the [[Princess Fiona's Tower]].


00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:19,000
CHARMING: He alone would climb to the highest room of the tallest tower to enter the princess’s chambers, cross the room to her sleeping silhouette, pull back the gossamer curtains to find her--

Charming pulls the curtain and gasps; the figure is no princess--its the Big Bad Wolf. The wolf, busy reading a magazine, is annoyed by the interruption.

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
WOLF: What?

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,680
CHARMING: Princess... Fiona?

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,080
WOLF: No!

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,560
CHARMING: Oh, thank heavens. Where is she?

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,680
WOLF: She’s on her honeymoon.

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,680
CHARMING: Honeymoon? With whom?!

We see various scenes from Shrek and Fiona's honeymoon. They break into a giant [[gingerbread house]] and stay night. In the morning Little Red Riding Hood knocks on the door, fleeing in terror after Shrek and Fiona answer the door.

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,680
LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD: screams

They take the [[basket]] she left and have a picnic on the beach. A wave crashes over Shrek and Fiona as they makeout in the sand and The Little Mermaid takes Fiona's place. Fiona drags the mermaid by the tail, and throws her into the sea into a group of sharks.

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,680
THE LITTLE MERMAID: Ow ow ow ow ahhhhh

Later, Shrek has some [[dwarves]] forge Fiona's [[wedding ring]]. They run happily thru a meadow where an angry mob emerges chasing after them. Shrek gets caught a trap and villagers surround Fiona, who fends them off. They take turns farting in a mud bath, using fairies trapped in jars for light. They kiss in the moonlight, transitioning to...


...their arrival back at [[Shrek's swamp]].

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:03,880
SHREK: It’s so good to be home! Just you and me and...

Shrek scoops Fiona about in his arms and walks to the door of his home.
Singing can be heard from inside.


They open the door to find Donkey laying in Shrek's chair.

00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,800
DONKEY: (singing) Two can be as bad as one…

00:05:09,000--> 00:05:10,000
SHREK: Donkey?

Shrek sets Fiona down.

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:22,680
DONKEY: Shrek! Fiona! Well aren’t you two a sight for sore eyes! Give us a hug, Shrek, you old love machine. (chuckles) And look at you, Mrs. Shrek. How ‘bout a side of sugar for the steed?

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,000
SHREK: Donkey, what are you doing here?

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,080
DONKEY: Oh! I was just taking care of your love nest for you.

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,250
SHREK: Oh, you mean like… sorting [[the mail]] and watering [[the plants]]?

Shrek gestures to piles of mail stacked on a stool and potted plants that have withered away.

00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,040
DONKEY: Yeah, and feeding the fish!

00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,320
SHREK: I don’t have any fish.

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,640
DONKEY: You do now. I call that one Shrek and the other Fiona. That Shrek is a rascally devil. Get your… (mumbling)

Donkey walks over to a [[fish bowl]]. The water is rancid and the two fish are clearly dead.

00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,000
SHREK: Oh, will you look at the time! Well I guess you’d better be going.

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,080
DONKEY: Hey wait a minute, don’t you want to tell me all about your trip? Or how about a game of Parcheesi?

00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,920
FIONA: Um, actually--Donkey? Shouldn’t you be getting home to Dragon?

00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:58,880
DONKEY: Oh, yeah, that. I don’t know. She’s been all moody and stuff lately...so I thought I’d move back in with you guys!

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,240
FIONA: Well you know we’re always happy to see you, Donkey.

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,680
SHREK: But Fiona and I are married now. We need a little time, you know, to be together.

Donkey smiles and stares at Shrek, not taking the hint.

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,040
SHREK: Just with each other.

Donkey continues to stare.

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,900
SHREK: Alone.

00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,000
DONKEY: Say no more, say no more. You don’t have to worry about a thing. I will always be here to make sure nobody bothers you!

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,000
SHREK: Donkey!

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
DONKEY: Yes, roomie?

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,840
SHREK: You’re bothering me.

00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:33,080
DONKEY: Oh, OK. All right, cool. I guess uh… me and Pinocchio was gonna catch a tournament, anyway, so uh.... maybe I’ll see y’all Sunday for a barbecue or somethin'.

00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,600
SHREK: He’ll be fine. Now, where were we?

00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,400
SHREK: Oh. I think I remember.

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,640
SHREK: Donkey!

In his surprise, Shrek drops Fiona to floor. He leans down to pick her up.

00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,400
DONKEY: I know, I know! ''Alone''! I’m going! I’m going! Hey, but what do you want me to tell these other guys?


A group of uniformed men stand outside, playing a [[fanfare]] with their trumpets and drums. A page steps forth with a scroll in his hand. After the fanfare is over, one of the trumpeters begins play the Hawaii Five-0 Theme Song. The ROYAL MESSENGER smacks him on the head with his scroll. Shrek and Fiona step outside of the house.

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:39,400
ROYAL MESSENGER: Enough, Reggie. (clears throat) "Dearest Princess Fiona. You are hereby summoned to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away for a royal ball in celebration of your marriage ...at which time the King will bestow his royal blessing… upon you and your…eh... uh…Prince Charming. Love, the King and Queen of Far Far Away. A.K.A. Mum and Dad."

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,240
FIONA: Mum and Dad?

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,240
SHREK: Prince Charming?

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,200
DONKEY: Royal ball?! Can I come?

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,800
SHREK: We’re not going.

00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,840
FIONA & DONKEY: What?!

00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,800
SHREK: I mean, don’t you think they might be a bit… shocked to see you like this?

00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:01,640
FIONA: Well, they might be a bit surprised. But they’re my parents, Shrek. They love me. And don’t worry, they're gonna love you too.

00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,120
SHREK: Yeah, right. Somehow I don’t think I’ll be welcome at the country club.

00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,080
FIONA: Will you Stop it? They’re not like that.

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,480
SHREK: Then how do you explain Sergeant Pompous and the Fancy Pants Club Band?

00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,720
FIONA: Oh, come on! You could at least give them a chance.

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
SHREK: To do what? Sharpen their pitchforks?

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,840
FIONA: No! They just want to give you their blessing.

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,840
SHREK: Oh, great. Now I need their blessing?

00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,280
FIONA: well If you want to be a part of this family, yes!

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,320
SHREK: And who says I want to be part of this family?

00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,280
FIONA: Uh, you did! When you married me?!

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,160
SHREK: Well, there’s some fine print for you!

00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,160
FIONA: Ugh! So that’s it, you won’t come?

00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:41,120
Shrek: Trust me. It’s a bad idea. We are not going! And that’s final!

After a silence, we cut to Fiona throwing the last of their luggage into the back of [[the carriage]]

00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,840
DONKEY: Hey come on Shrek! We don’t want to hit traffic!

00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,840
GINGY: Don’t worry! We’ll take care of everything.

Shrek reluctantly leaves the house. Gingy, Pinocchio, the Three Little Pigs, the Big Bad Wolf, and the The Three Blind Mice run inside. One of the mice is running to catch up.

00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:51,522
BLIND MOUSE: Hey, wait for me!

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,800
DONKEY: (singing): Hit it! Move ‘em on! Head ‘em up! Head ‘em up, move ‘em on! Head ‘em up! Move ‘em down! Rawhide! Move 'em on! Head ‘em up! Head ‘em up! Move ‘em on! Move ‘em on! Head ‘em up! Rawhide! Ride ‘em up! Move ‘em on!


Donkey continues to sing.

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:23,880
DONKEY: Head ‘em up! Head ‘em up! Move ‘em on! Rawhide! Knock ‘em out! Pound ‘em dead! Make ‘em tea! Buy ‘em drinks! Meet their mamas! Milk ‘em hard! Rawhide! Yee-haw!

Later, they reach a 700 miles to [[Far Far Away sign]].

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,640
DONKEY: Are we there yet?

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,880
SHREK: No.

They are now riding in the rain over rocky terrain.

00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,960
DONKEY: Are we there yet?

00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,760
FIONA: Not yet.

The are now in snowy mountains. There's a 200 miles to [[Far Far Away sign]].

00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,200
DONKEY: OK, are we there yet?

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,360
FIONA: No.

More time passes and they are riding through thick snow.

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,880
DONKEY: Are we there yet?

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,920
SHREK: ''No''!

They are riding out of the snowy area.

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,000
DONKEY: Are we there yet?

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,160
SHREK: Yes.

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,160
DONKEY: Really?

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,040
SHREK: No!!

They pass by a [[waterfall]] and over a bridge.

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,040
DONKEY: Are we there yet?

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,040
FIONA: No!


They pass a 100 miles to [[Far Far Away sign]].

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,600
DONKEY: Are we there yet?!

00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,600
SHREK: ''No, we are not''!

Later as they pass through the forest, their dwarf driver is now covering his ears as he holds the reigns.

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
DONKEY: ''Are we there yet''?!

00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
SHREK & FIONA: ''No''!!

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,960
DONKEY: Are we there yet?

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,960
SHREK: Are we there yet?

00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,960
DONKEY: Hey that’s not funny.

00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,960
SHREK: Hey that’s not funny.

00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,960
DONKEY: Hey that’s really immature.

00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,960
SHREK: Hey that’s really immature.

00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,960
DONKEY: See this is why nobody likes ogres.

00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,960
SHREK: See this is why nobody likes ogres.

00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
DONKEY: Alright your loss!

00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
SHREK: Alright your loss!

00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
DONKEY: I’m gonna just stop talking!

00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
SHREK: Finally!

00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,960
DONKEY: But this is taking forever, Shrek. And there ain't no in-flight movie or nothing!

00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:22,960
SHREK: The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey. That’s where we’re going. ''Far'', ''far''… (softly) away!

00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,960
DONKEY: All right, all right, I get it. I’m just so darn bored!

00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
SHREK: Well, find a way to entertain yourself!

00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:58,600
SHREK: Oh! For five minutes. Could you not be yourself…''for five minutes''!

Fiona leans against the window and looks out. She looks back to see Donkey's mouth lean forward. She braces herself and Donkey makes the popping noise again.

00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,720
SHREK: Gah!! Are we there yet?!

00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,120
FIONA: (chuckles) Yes!

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,480
DONKEY: Oh, finally!


00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,040
DONKEY: Wow! It’s going to be champagne wishes and caviar dreams from now on!

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,320
DONKEY: Hey, good-looking! We’ll be back to pick you up later! Ooo, pantyhose!

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,360
SHREK: We are definitely not in the swamp anymore.

A crossing guard dressed in full armor brings them to a halt as a [[limousine-esque carriage]] passes by.

00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,760
DONKEY: Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh? Yeah! You workin' that hat!

A loud crowd has now amassed behind them. They head up the avenue and towards [[the palace]] further up the road.

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,480
DONKEY: Swimming pools! Movie stars!


A cheering crowd is gathered in front of [[the palace]], filling up the entirety of the square. Confetti rains and fanfare plays. The king and queen stand waiting in front of the palace doors. The carriage pulls and stops in front of the red carpet leading to the palace. An announcer pulls out a scroll and reads it aloud.

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:08,320
ANNOUNCER: Announcing the long-awaited return of the beautiful Princess Fiona and her new husband!

The crowd cheers.

00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,800
FIONA: Well, this is it.

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,000
HAROLD: This is it.

00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,000
ANNOUNCER: This is it.

A man with a box of doves gets ready to open it.

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
MAN: This is it.

The birds are released and a fanfare is played as Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey step out of [[the carriage]]. The crowd gasps, the fanfare dies off, and one of the doves smacks into a wall and falls dead to the ground. The king and queen stand with mouths wide open. It is totally silent. A baby starts crying.

00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,040
DONKEY: Uh… why don’t you guys go ahead? I’ll park the car.

Donkey jumps into [[the carriage]] and the driver starts riding off. Shrek takes takes Fiona's hand and starts walking forward.

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,840
SHREK: So… (chuckles) ...you still think this was a good idea?

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,560
FIONA: Of course! Look! Mom and Dad look happy to see us.

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,280
HAROLD: Who on earth are they?

00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,280
LILLIAN: I think that’s our little girl.

00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:03,800
HAROLD: That’s not little! That’s a really big problem! Wasn’t she supposed to kiss Prince Charming and break the spell?

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,640
LILLIAN: Well, he’s no Prince Charming, but they do look--

00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:13,120
SHREK: Happy now? We came. We saw them. Now let’s go before they light the torches.

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,880
FIONA: They’re my parents!

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,080
SHREK: Hello? They locked you in a tower!

00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,800
FIONA: Hey! That was for my own--

00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,560
HAROLD: Good! Now here’s our chance. Let’s go back inside and pretend we’re not home!

00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,120
LILLIAN: Harold, we have to be--

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,320
SHREK: Quick! While they’re not looking we could make a run for it.

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,700
FIONA: Shrek! Stop it! Everything’s gonna be--

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,320
HAROLD: A disaster! There is no way--

00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
FIONA: You can do this.

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,960
SHREK: I really--

00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,160
HAROLD: Really--

00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,160
LILLIAN: Really--

00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,160
FIONA: Don't--

00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,160
HAROLD: Want--

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,960
SHREK: To…

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,960
LILLIAN: Be--

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,960
SHREK & HAROLD: Here.

The four stand facing each other. After a brief silence, Fiona goes up to hug Lillian and Harold.

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,360
FIONA: Mom, dad. I’d like you to meet my husband…Shrek.

00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,360
SHREK: Well, um… It’s easy to see where Fiona gets her good looks from.


00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,840
FIONA: Excuse me.

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,520
SHREK: Better out than in, I always say, eh, Fiona?

00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,040
SHREK: That’s good...

00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,960
SHREK: I guess not...


00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,400
DONKEY: Hey! What’s happening, everybody? Thanks for waiting. You know I had the hardest time finding this place.

00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,680
HAROLD: No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down!

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,400
FIONA: No, no, no, Dad! It’s all right! It’s all right. He’s with us. He helped rescue me from the dragon.

00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,080
DONKEY: Yup that's me. The noble steed. Hey waiter! How ‘bout a bowl for the steed?

00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,280
SHREK: Oh, boy...

00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,940
FIONA: Um, Shrek?

00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:16,440
SHREK: Yeah?..Oh! Sorry! Great soup, Mrs Q. Mmm!

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,920
FIONA: No, no. Darling.

00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,320
SHREK: Oh!

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,560
LILLIAN: So, Fiona, tell us about where you live.

00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:32,560
FIONA: Well…Shrek owns his own land. Don’t you, honey?

00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:42,080
SHREK: Oh, yes! It’s in an enchanted forest abundant in squirrels and...cute little duckies and--

00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,240
DONKEY: What?! (laughing) I know you ain’t talking about the swamp!

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,900
SHREK: (through his teeth) Donkey!

00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,000
HAROLD: (sarcastically) An ogre from a swamp. Oh! How original.

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,280
LILLIAN: Well, I suppose that would be a fine place to raise the children...

Harold starts choking on his drink and Shrek accidentally swallows his spoon. They both gag until Shrek spits his spoon out onto the table.

00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,120
SHREK: (chuckling) It’s a bit early to be thinking about that, isn’t it?

00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,480
HAROLD: Indeed...I just started ''eating''.

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:08,980
LILLIAN: Harold!

00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,200
SHREK: (offended) What’s that supposed to mean?

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,480
FIONA: Dad. It’s great, OK?

00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,480
HAROLD: Well for his type, yes.

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,880
SHREK: ''My'' type?!

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,240
DONKEY: Uhhh--I gotta go to the bathroom.

The chef and a host of servers enter the room with dinner, including a whole turkey , lobster, and a pig.

00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,360
CHEF: Dinner is served!

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:19,900
DONKEY: Never mind. I can hold it.

The servers set the food on the table.

00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,880
CHEF: Bon appetit!

00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,720
DONKEY: Ooh, Mexican food! My favorite!

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,840
LILLIAN: Well, let’s not just sit here with our tummies rumbling. Everybody dig in!

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,640
DONKEY: Don’t mind if I do, Lillian.

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,400
HAROLD: So, I suppose any grandchildren I could expect from you would be--

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,720
SHREK: Ogres, yes!

Harold pulls the lobster towards himself, Shrek does the same with the turkey.

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,640
LILLIAN: Not that there’s anything wrong with that. ''Right'', Harold?

00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,000
HAROLD: Oh, no! No! Of course, not! That is, assuming you don’t eat your own young!

Harold violently stabs into [[the lobster]] with a knife.

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,700
FIONA: Dad!

00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,920
SHREK: Oh no, we usually prefer the ones who’ve been locked away in a tower!

Shrek rips off both drumsticks off the turkey and bites them.

00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,560
FIONA: Shrek, please!

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,560
HAROLD: I only did that because I love her!

00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,240
SHREK: Oh, aye! Daycare or dragon-guarded castle?!

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,080
HAROLD: You wouldn’t understand! You’re not her father!

Fiona sighs as Shrek and Harold continue to rip apart their food, sending bits and pieces flying across the table.

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,080
LILLIAN: It’s so nice to have the family together for dinner.

Harold and Shrek tug over [[the roast pig]] in the middle of the table, accidentally sending it flying upwards.

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,160
LILLIAN: Harold!

00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,360
FIONA: Shrek!

00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,860
SHREK: Fiona?!

00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,200
HAROLD: Fiona!

00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,000
FIONA: Mom!

00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,540
LILLIAN: Harold…

00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,840
DONKEY: Donkey!

The pig lands on the table with a thud. Fiona looks at Harold and Shrek, and then runs out of the room.


00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:42,840
GODMOTHER: (singing) Your fallen tears have called to me / So, here comes my sweet remedy / I know what every princess needs / For her to live life happily…

The woman floats up to her and pops the bubble. She notices Fiona, and both gasp.

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,120
GODMOTHER: Oh! Oh my dear. Oooh, look at you, you're all um...grown up. (chuckles)

00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,520
FIONA: Um, who are you?

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,280
GODMOTHER: Oh, sweet pea! I’m your Fairy Godmother.

00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,600
FIONA: I have a fairy godmother?

00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:06,640
GODMOTHER: Shu-shu-shu--shush, shush. Now, don’t worry. I’m here to make it all better. With...just...a…

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:30,760
GODMOTHER: ...wave of my magic wand! / Your troubles will soon be gone! / With a flick of the wrist and just a flash / You’ll land a prince with a ton of cash. A high-priced dress made by mice no less / Some crystal glass pumps / And no more stress. Your worries will vanish, your soul will cleanse / Confide in your very own furniture friends We’ll help you set a new fashion trend! I’ll make you fancy, I’ll make you great

00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,720
FURNITURE: The kind of girl a prince would date!

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,120
GODMOTHER: They’ll write your name on the bathroom wall…

00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,120
MIRROR: For a happy ever after, give Fiona a call!

00:20:36,120 --> 00:21:08,920
GODMOTHER: A sporty carriage to ride in style / Sexy man my chauffeur, Kyle. Banish your blemishes, tooth decay / Cellulite thighs will fade away! / And oh, what the hey! / Have a bichon frisé! Nip and tuck, here and there / To land that prince with the perfect hair / Lipstick liners, shadows blush / To get that prince with the sexy tush / Lucky day, hunk buffet / You and your prince take a roll in the hay / You can spoon on the moon / With the prince to the tune / Don’t be drab, you’ll be fab / Your prince will have rock-hard abs / Cheese soufflé, Valentine’s Day / Have some chicken fricassee! / Nip and tuck, here and there / To land that prince with the perfect hair--

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,920
FIONA: ''Stop!!''

The music stops and Fiona's fancy dress turns to dust.

00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,420
FIONA: (chuckles) Look...thank you very much, Fairy Godmother, but I really don’t need all this.

Shrek starts knocking at the door and a shelf moves over to block it.

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,880
SHREK: Fiona? Fiona?

He forces his way in and to see Fairy Godmother floating next to Fiona, who has [[the puppy]] in her arms. The furniture move back to their original positions. Godmother looks surprised to see Shrek. Donkey comes running in.

00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,120
DONKEY: Oh! You got a puppy? All I got in my room was shampoo.

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:41,720
FIONA: Oh...uh…Fairy Godmother, furniture…I’d like you to meet my husband, Shrek.

00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,240
GODMOTHER: (in disbelief) Your ''husband''? What--what did you say? When did this happen?

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,040
FIONA: Shrek is the one who rescued me.

00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,440
GODMOTHER: But that can’t be right!

00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,880
SHREK: Oh, great, more relatives!

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,080
FIONA: She’s just trying to help.

00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,240
SHREK: Good! She can help us pack. Get your coat, dear. We’re leaving.

Shrek opens up his suitcase.

00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,880
FIONA: What?

00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,560
DONKEY: Leaving? I don’t want to leave.

00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,120
FIONA: When did you decide this?

00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,100
SHREK: Shortly after arriving.

00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,400
FIONA: Look, I I’m sorry…

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:09,680
GODMOTHER: No no no no, that’s all right. I need to go, anyway. But remember, dear, if you should ever need me…happiness…is just a teardrop away.

Godmother holds out a [[business card]] to Fiona, but Shrek snatches it out of her hand.

00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,600
SHREK: Thanks, but we’ve got all the happiness we need. Happy, happy, happy!

00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,920
GODMOTHER: So I see...let’s go, Kyle.

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,920
FIONA: Very nice, Shrek.

00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,640
SHREK: What? I told you coming here was a bad idea.

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,280
FIONA: You could’ve at least tried to get along with my father!

00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,600
SHREK: Ya know, somehow I don’t think I was going to get Daddy’s blessing even if I did want it!


00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,120
FIONA: Well do you think it might be nice if somebody asked me what I wanted?

00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,420
SHREK: ''Sure''. Do you want me to pack for you?

00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,280
FIONA: You’re unbelievable! You’re behaving like a…

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,200
SHREK: Go on! Say it!

00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,920
FIONA: Like an ogre!

00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,760
SHREK: Well here’s a news flash for you! Whether your parents like it or not… I ''am'' an ogre!

The dog continues to bark and Shrek roars in its face. It stops and cowers.

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,800
SHREK: And guess what, princess? That’s not about to change.

00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,560
FIONA: I’ve made changes for you, Shrek. Think about that.

Fiona steps out and the lets the door slam behind her.

00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:23,080
DONKEY: That’s real smooth, Shrek. "I’m an ogre!" (mimics Shrek roaring)


00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,840
HAROLD: I knew this would happen.

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,520
LILLIAN: You should. You started it.

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,960
HAROLD: I can hardly believe that, Lillian. I mean really, ''he’s'' the ogre. Not me.

00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:00,120
LILLIAN: I think, Harold, you’re taking this a little too personally. This is Fiona’s choice.

00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:08,040
HAROLD: Yes, but she was supposed to choose the prince ''we'' picked out for her! I mean, you expect me to give my blessings to this…this...thing?

00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:14,320
LILLIAN: Fiona does. And she’ll never forgive you if you don’t. I don’t want to lose our daughter again, Harold.

00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:24,880
LILLIAN: Ugh, you act as if love is totally predictable. Don’t you remember when ''we'' were young? And oh, we used to walk down by the lily pond and they were in bloom…

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:32,440
HAROLD: (starting to reminisce) Our first kiss... (snapping out of it) it’s not the same! I don’t think you realize that our daughter has married a monster!

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,720
LILLIAN: Oh, stop being such a drama king.

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:43,080
HAROLD: Fine! Fine! Pretend there’s nothing wrong! (dances around) La, di, da, di, da, di da! Isn’t it all wonderful! I’d like to know how it could get any worse!

00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,920
GODMOTHER: Hello, Harold.

Harold yelps.

00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,360
LILLIAN: What happened?

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,200
HAROLD: Uh, nothing! Nothing, dear! Just the old crusade wound playing up a bit! (chuckles) I’ll... just stretch it out here for a while!

He walks out to the balcony and shuts the doors behind him.

00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,240
GODMOTHER: You better get in. We need to talk.

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:06,240
HAROLD: Actually, Fairy Godmother, off to bed. (yawns) Already taken my pills, and they tend to make me a bit drowsy. So, um how about… ...uh, we, we make this a quick visit. What? What?


00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,480
HAROLD: Oh, hello. Ha-ha-ha! So, what’s new?

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,200
GODMOTHER: You remember my son, Prince Charming?

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,840
HAROLD: Charming! Oh! Is that you? My gosh! It's been years! How--when...when, when, when did you get back?

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:33,720
CHARMING: (calmly) Oh, about five minutes ago, actually... (angrily) after I endured blistering winds! Scorching desert! I climbed to the highest room of the tallest tower–-

00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:43,840
GODMOTHER: Mummy can handle this.. (continuing her son's rant) He endures blistering winds and scorching desert! He climbs to the highest bloody room of the tallest bloody tower!

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,600
HAROLD: But, but, but...

00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,640
GODMOTHER: And what does he find? Some gender-confused wolf telling him that his princess--

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,920
HAROLD: If I could just--

00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,160
GODMOTHER: --is already married!

00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,240
HAROLD: I mean, It wasn’t ''my'' fault. He didn’t get there in time.

00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,840
GODMOTHER: ''Stop the car''!

[[The carriage]] comes to a sudden stop.

00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,280
GODMOTHER: Harold...

The men crack their knuckles.

00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,760
GODMOTHER: You force me to do something I ''really'' don’t want to do.

Godmother rolls down the window.

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,160
HAROLD: (gasps) Where are we?

00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,120
PRICILLA: Well, hi there! Welcome to Friar’s Fat Boy, may I take your order?

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:16,600
GODMOTHER: My diet is ruined! I hope you’re happy. (turns to the clerk) Er… okay. Two Renaissance Wraps, no mayo… chili ring...

00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,040
CHARMING: I’ll have the Medieval Meal.

00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,720
GODMOTHER: Yeah, one Medieval Meal and Harold… curly fries?

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,040
HAROLD: No, thank you.

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,040
GODMOTHER: Sourdough soft taco, then?

00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,040
HAROLD: No, really, I’m fine.

00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,440
PRICILLA: Your order, Fairy Godmother.

The clerk hands her their order in a bad, and then a large [[battle-axe]].

00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,600
PRICILLA: And ''this'' comes with the Medieval Meal.

00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:37,200
GODMOTHER: There you are, dear. You see we made a deal, Harold, and I assume you don’t want me to go back on my part.

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,560
HAROLD: (sighs) Indeed not.

00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,720
GODMOTHER: So Fiona and Charming ''will'' be together.

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,420
HAROLD: Yes.

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:52,920
GODMOTHER: Oh, believe me, Harold. It’s what’s best. Not only for your daughter… ...but for your Kingdom.


They arrive back at the balcony of the master bedroom and Harold is pushed out.

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,360
HAROLD: What am I supposed to do about it?

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,640
GODMOTHER: Use your imagination.

Godmother shuts the door and [[the carriage]] flies off. Harold stands unsure, still clutching the axe, staring out at the moon.


A hooded man on horseback arrives at [[The Poison Apple]], a ramshackle tavern. The man is Harold in disguise. He dismounts his horse and enters the tavern. He knocks on the door and an eye peeks out.

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,200
CYCLOPS: Oh…uh come on in, Your Majesty.

Cyclops opens the door and lets Harold in.


The tavern is a seedy gathering of misfits. [[Pirates and witches]] sit at the tables. Two trees arm wrestle and two dwarfs fight. Someone is playing darts with throwing axes.

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,880
CAPTAIN HOOK: (sings in background)

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,880
HEADLESS HORSEMAN: burps

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,880
HAROLD: (clears his throat) Um, excuse me?

He turns to look down at a Miss Frog sipping a martini on a stool.

00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,120
MISS FROG: Hey. Do I know you?

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:14,320
HAROLD: Uh, no, you must be mistaking me for someone else. Uh… excuse me. I’m looking for the Ugly Stepsister.

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:23,200
HAROLD:  Ah! There you are. Right. You see, I...I need to have someone ''taken care of''.

00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,240
DORIS: (in a deep voice) Who’s the guy?

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,600
HAROLD:  Well, he’s not a guy, per se. Um… He’s an ogre.

The whole tavern gasps and Hook stop playing.

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:40,480
DORIS: Hey, buddy, let me clue you in. There’s only one fella who can handle a job like that, and, frankly…he don't like to be disturbed.

00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,520
HAROLD:  Where could I find him?

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,160
HAROLD: H-Hello?

A pair of bright green eyes appear from the darkness.

00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,880
PUSS: Who dares enter my room?

00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:57,480
HAROLD: Sorry! I hope I’m not interrupting, but I’m told you’re the one to talk to about an...ogre problem?

00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,160
PUSS: You are told correct, but for this I charge a great deal of money.

00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,440
HAROLD: Would… this be enough?

Harold tosses a small sack onto the table. Out from the shadows, a sword slices open the sack and gold coins spill out onto the table.

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:21,760
PUSS: Hmm. You have engaged my valuable services...your Majesty. Just tell me where I can find this ogre.


00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:25,560
FIONA: Dear Diary. Sleeping Beauty is having a slumber party tomorrow, but Dad says I can’t go. He ''never'' lets me out after sunset. Dad says I’m going away for a while. Must be like some finishing school or something. Mom says that when I’m old enough, my Handsome Prince Charming will rescue me from my tower and bring me back to my family! And we'll all live happily ever after! Mrs. Fiona Charming.

He frantically turns the pages which all read aloud "Mrs. Fiona Charming". He is surprised by a knock at the door, and sets the diary down. He opens the door to see Harold standing in the hall.

00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,840
HAROLD: Sorry. I hope I’m not interrupting anything.

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,960
SHREK: No, no. I was just reading a, uh…a scary book.

00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,400
HAROLD: I was hoping you’d let me apologize for my despicable behavior earlier.

00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,880
SHREK: Okay?..

00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,560
HAROLD: I don’t know what came over me. Do you suppose we could pretend it never happened and start over?

00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,360
SHREK: Look, Your Majesty, I just…

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,160
SHREK: Please, call me Dad.

00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:13,000
SHREK: Dad. We both acted like ogres. Maybe we just need some time to get to know each other.

00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:23,600
HAROLD: Excellent idea! I was actually hoping you might join me for a morning hunt. A little...father-son time? I know it would mean the world to Fiona.

Shrek stares back at Fiona, still asleep, then sighs.

00:33:33,440 --> 00:32:36,280
HAROLD: Shall we say 7:30 by the old oak?


Shrek and Donkey are walking through a thick forest. [[The Far Far Away Palace]] is far off over the hills behind them.

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,360
SHREK: Face it, Donkey! We’re lost.

00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:50,600
DONKEY: We can’t be lost! We followed the king’s instructions exactly. What did he say? "Head to the darkest part of the woods…"

00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,000
SHREK: Aye.

00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,640
DONKEY: "Past the sinister trees with those scary-looking branches."

00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,640
SHREK: Check.

00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,920
DONKEY: Yeah, and there’s the bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!

00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,960
SHREK: We passed that bush three times already!

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,680
DONKEY: Hey, you were the one who said you didn't want to stop and get directions.

00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:08,040
SHREK: Oh, great. My one chance to fix things up with Fiona’s dad, and I end up lost in the woods with you!

00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,040
DONKEY: Alright you don’t have to get huffy with me, I’m only trying to help.

00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:16,160
SHREK: I know! I know. (sighs) I’m sorry, all right?

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,480
DONKEY: Hey, don’t worry about it.

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,200
SHREK: I just really need to make things work with this guy.

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,760
DONKEY: Yeah, sure. Now let’s go bond with Daddy.

00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,320
SHREK: Well, well, well, Donkey. I know it was kind of a tender moment back there, but the purring?

00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,720
DONKEY: Man, what are you talking about? I ain’t purring.

00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,920
SHREK: Oh, ''sure''. What’s next? A hug?

00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,720
DONKEY: Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don’t purr. What do you think I am, some kind of a…

00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,640
PUSS: Ha-ha! Fear me, if you dare! (hisses)

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,080
SHREK: Hey look! A little cat.

00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,080
DONKEY: Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!

00:33:52,640 --> 00:34:00,760
SHREK: It’s a cat, Donkey. Come here, little kitty, kitty. Come on, little kitty. Come here. Oh! Come here, little kitty.

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,760
DONKEY: Hold on, Shrek! I’m coming!

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:11,960
SHREK: Come on! Oh, get it off! Oh, get it off! Oh, God. Oh… No! Ooh! Aagh!

00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,840
SHREK: Get it off!

00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,840
DONKEY: Shrek! Hold still!

00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,360
DONKEY: Did I miss?

00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,240
SHREK: No. You got them.

00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:35,920
PUSS: Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from… Puss in Boots!

He cuts a letter [[P mark in a tree]], similar to Zorro.

00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,560
SHREK: (furious) Ohh, I’ll kill that cat!

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,640
PUSS: Ah-ha-ha!

Puss starts coughing and then heaving onto the floor. Shrek and Donkey stand confused until Puss finally spits out a [[hairball]].

00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,800
PUSS: (chuckles) Hairball.

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,080
DONKEY: Oh! That is nasty!

Shrek picks Puss up by the back of the neck.

00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,800
SHREK: What should we do with him?

00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,040
DONKEY: I say we take the sword and neuter him right here. Give him the Bob Barker treatment!

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:20,760
PUSS: (frightened) Oh, no! Por favor! Please! I implore you! It was nothing personal, Señor! I was doing it only for my family. My mother, she is sick. And my father lives off the garbage! The king offered me much in gold and I have a litter of brothers…

00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,680
SHREK: Whoa...whoa...whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! ''Fiona’s father'' paid you to do this?

00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,200
PUSS: The rich King? Sí.

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,160
SHREK: Well, so much for Dad’s royal blessing.

00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,520
DONKEY: Oh come on, Shrek, don’t feel bad. Almost everybody that meets you wants to kill you.

00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:46,040
SHREK: Gee, thanks. (sighs) Maybe Fiona would’ve been better off if I were some sort of Prince Charming.

00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,440
PUSS: Si, that’s what the King said.

00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,000
PUSS: Oh, uh… sorry. I thought that question was directed at me.

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,120
DONKEY: Shrek, Fiona knows you’d do anything for her.

00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:13,680
SHREK: Well, it’s not like I wouldn’t change if I could. I just… I just wish I could make her happy. Hold the phone…

Shrek pulls out the [[business card]] he took from Fairy Godmother earlier. He reads it.

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:18,480
SHREK: "Happiness." "A tear drop away." Donkey! Think of the saddest thing that’s ever happened to you.

00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:35,920
DONKEY: Aw, man, where do I begin? Well first there was the time that old farmer tried to sell me for some magic beans. I ain't never got over that. Then this fool went off and had a party and he have the guests trying to pin the tail on me. Then they got all drunk and start beating me with a stick going, "Piñata! Piñata!" What is a piñata, anyway?!

00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,760
SHREK: No, Donkey! I need you to cry!

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,280
DONKEY: Yeah, well don’t go projecting on me! I know you’re feeling bad, but you gotta let your own--

Puss forcefully steps on Donkey's hoof. Donkey screams in pain.

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,080
DONKEY: You little, hairy, litter-licking sack of...

Donkey sheds a tear, and Shrek lets it fall onto the card. A bubble is conjured, and Fairy Godmother appears in it.

00:36:54,120 --> 00:37:07,800
GODMOTHER: What? Is it on? Is it on? (clears throat) This is Fairy Godmother. I’m either away from my desk or with a client. But if you come by the office, we’ll be glad to make you a personal appointment. Have a happy ever after.

The bubble bursts into sparkling dust.

00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,200
SHREK: Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?

00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:19,440
DONKEY: That’s more like it! Shrek and Donkey, on another whirlwind adventure! (Singing) Ain’t no stoppin’ us now! Whoo! We’re on the move!

Shrek and Donkey start walking off.

00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,600
PUSS: Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you.

00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,600
SHREK: Join the club. We’ve got jackets.

00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:32,680
PUSS: On my honor, I am obliged to accompany you until I have saved your life as you have spared me mine.

00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,040
DONKEY: I'm sorry, the position of annoying talking animal has already been taken. Let’s go, Shrek! Shrek?

Shrek looks down at Puss, who gives him a cute, helpless look. Shrek smiles.

00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,920
DONKEY: Shrek!

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:57,400
SHREK: Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him… in his wee little boots. You know, how many cats can wear boots? Honestly. Aw, let’s keep him!

00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,920
DONKEY: Say what?!

00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,600
SHREK: Aw, listen. He’s purring!

00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,640
DONKEY: Oh, so now it’s cute!

00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,640
SHREK: Aw, come on, Donkey. Lighten up.

00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,920
DONKEY: Lighten up? Oh, I should lighten up?! Look who’s telling who to lighten up!


Fiona is awaken by the [[puppy]] licking her nose.

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,440
FIONA: (giggles) Shrek!

00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,280
FIONA: Shrek?


00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,720
LILLIAN: They’re both festive, aren’t they? What do you think, Harold?

00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,000
HAROLD: Um… yes, yes. Fine. Fine.

00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:45,920
LILLIAN: Try to at least pretend you’re interested in your daughter’s wedding ball.

00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,040
HAROLD: Honestly, Lillian, I don’t think it matters. How do we know there will even be a ball?

Fiona steps out from [[the palace]] doors.

00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,120
FIONA: Mom! Dad!

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,120
LILLIAN: Oh, hello, dear.

00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,840
HAROLD: What’s that, Cedric? Right! Coming!

Harold walks off before Fiona reaches them.

00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,400
FIONA: Mom, have you seen Shrek?

00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:05,280
LILLIAN: I haven’t. You should ask your father. Be sure and use small words, dear. He’s a little slow this morning.

00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,080
CEDRIC: Can I help you, Your Majesty?

00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,840
HAROLD: Ah, yes! Um…

Harold sticks his finger into the bowl and tastes it.

00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,560
HAROLD: Mmm! Exquisite. What do you call this dish?

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,480
CEDRIC: That would be the dog’s breakfast, Your Majesty.

00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,040
HAROLD: Ah, yes. Very good, then. Carry on, Cedric.

00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,440
FIONA: Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek?

00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:29,400
HAROLD: Uh, no I haven’t, dear. I’m sure he just went off to look for a nice… mud hole to cool down in. You know, after your little spat last night.

00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,720
FIONA: Oh. You heard that, huh?

00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:38,520
HAROLD: Darling, the whole kingdom heard you. I mean, after all, it is in his nature to be…well, a bit of a brute.

00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,800
FIONA: ''Him''? You know, you didn’t exactly roll out the Welcome Wagon!

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,600
HAROLD: Well, what did you expect?! Look at what he’s done to you.

00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:51,600
FIONA: Shrek loves me for who I am. I would think you’d be happy for me.

00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:58,400
HAROLD: Darling, I’m just thinking about what’s best for ''you''. Maybe you should do the same.


Donkey is walking behind Shrek, who is still carrying Puss. Donkey eyes Puss suspiciously as he whispers into Shrek's ear. Shrek glances back at Donkey.

00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,480
SHREK: No, really?

Shrek and Puss laugh. They walk out into a clearing.

00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,280
DONKEY: Oh…


Off in the distance they see a small cottage. Connected to it is a giant [[factory]] with colored gases rising out from its chimneys.

00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,240
DONKEY: Oh, no. That’s the ol' Keebler’s place! Let’s just back away slowly.

00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:35,760
PUSS: That’s the Fairy Godmother’s cottage. She’s the largest producer of hexes and potions in the whole kingdom.

00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,480
SHREK: Then why don’t we pop in there for a spell? Ha-ha! ''Spell''!

00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:41,280
PUSS: He makes me laugh!


00:40:51,274 --> 00:40:53,363
SHREK: Hi. I’m here to see the--

00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:56,454
JEROME: The Fairy Godmother. I’m sorry. She is not in.

Godmother's voice sounds from a speaker system next to the receptionist.

00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:59,761
GODMOTHER: Jerome, coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now!

00:41:01,154 --> 00:41:07,160
JEROME: (sighs) Yes, Fairy Godmother. Right away. Look, she’s not seeing any clients today, OK?

00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:10,119
SHREK: That’s OK, buddy. We’re from the union.

00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:10,119
JEROME: The union?

00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:14,950
SHREK: We represent the workers in all magical industries, both evil and benign.

00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:16,735
JEROME: Oh! Oh, right.

00:41:17,121 --> 00:41:20,090
SHREK: Are you feeling at all degraded or oppressed?

00:41:20,224 --> 00:41:23,853
JEROME: Uh… a little. W--w--we don’t even have dental.

00:41:23,961 --> 00:41:35,829
SHREK: They don’t even have dental. Okay, we're just gonna have a look around. Oh. By the way. I think it’d be better if the Fairy Godmother didn’t know we were here. Know what I’m saying? Huh?

00:41:33,803 --> 00:41:34,829
DONKEY: Hmm?

00:41:34,803 --> 00:41:35,829
SHREK: Huh?

00:41:34,803 --> 00:41:36,829
DONKEY: Huh? Huh? Huh?!

00:41:36,007 --> 00:41:39,204
SHREK: Stop it.

00:41:36,007 --> 00:41:39,204
JEROME: (whispers) Of course. Go right in.

The three walk through a door next to the receptionist.


From up above on a catwalk, the three look out at the factory. The workers are all elves wearing white hazmat suits. Chemicals are poured into giant vats. Potions are put onto conveyor belts. Ingredients are tested and mixed. Shrek notices a set of doors at the other end of the room with a sign above that reads [[Potion Room]]. They see flashing lights accompanied by booming sounds coming from a doorway to their right. They head inside and walk down a hallway, which leads to another set of doors. They can hear the Godmother behind it as well as the source of the flashes.

00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:10,300
GODMOTHER: A drop of desire! (giggles) Naughty!

Inside a [[giant cauldron]] pours out gas as Godmother dumps various vials into it.

00:42:14,445 --> 00:42:15,072
GODMOTHER: A pinch of passion. (laughs) And just a hint of…lust! (laughs)

00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,994
SHREK: Excuse me.

00:42:31,095 --> 00:42:32,756
SHREK: Sorry to barge in like this but uh--

00:42:32,863 --> 00:42:35,991
GODMOTHER: What in Grimm’s name are you doing here?

00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:41,037
SHREK: Well...it seems that Fiona’s not exactly happy.

00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:48,171
GODMOTHER: Oh-ho-ho! And there’s some question as to why that is? Well, let’s explore that, shall we?

00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:53,783
GODMOTHER: Ah. P, P, P, P, P…Princess.

She pulls out a book titled "Cinderella".

00:42:53,984 --> 00:42:59,281
GODMOTHER: Cinderella! Here we are. "Lived happily ever after." Oh…(laughs) No ogres!

00:43:00,858 --> 00:43:04,589
GODMOTHER: Let’s see. Snow White. A handsome prince. Oh...no ogres.

She continues to pull out books and toss them.

00:43:04,695 --> 00:43:15,932
GODMOTHER: Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres! Hansel and Gretel? No! Thumbelina? No. The Golden Bird, the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman…No, no, no, no, no!

She flies down and gets in Shrek's face.

00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:20,409
GODMOTHER: You see, ogres don’t live happily ever after.

00:43:20,511 --> 00:43:22,103
SHREK: All right, look, lady!

00:43:22,213 --> 00:43:25,876
GODMOTHER: Don’t you point… those dirty green sausages at me!

00:43:27,384 --> 00:43:29,079
WORKER: Your Monte Cristo and coffee--oh! Sorry.

00:43:30,821 --> 00:43:37,812
SHREK: Ah… that’s okay. We were just leaving. Very sorry to have wasted your time, Miss Godmother.

00:43:38,062 --> 00:43:41,825
GODMOTHER: Just… go. Come on, guys.

00:43:57,148 --> 00:44:03,648
SHREK: TGIF, eh, buddy? Working hard or hardly working, eh, Mac?

He enters the [[Potion Room]] he saw earlier. He opens the cart to reveal Puss and Donkey crammed inside.

00:44:12,897 --> 00:44:18,458
DONKEY: Hey man, you wanna get your fine Corinthian footwear and your cat cheeks out of my face? Man, that stinks!

00:44:18,602 --> 00:44:21,799
PUSS:  Well you don’t exactly smell like a basket of roses.

00:44:24,742 --> 00:44:29,304
SHREK: Well, one of these has got to help.

00:44:29,413 --> 00:44:32,473
PUSS: Ah, I was just concocting this very plan. Already our minds are becoming one.

00:44:32,616 --> 00:44:39,485
DONKEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa now. Listen, if we need an expert on licking ourselves, we’ll give you a call. Shrek, this is a bad idea.

00:44:32,616 --> 00:44:45,485
SHREK: Look. Make yourself useful and go keep watch. Puss, do you think you could get to those on top?

00:44:45,996 --> 00:44:52,021
PUSS: No problema, boss. In one of my nine lives I was the great cat burglar of Santiago de Compostela! (laughs)

00:44:52,469 --> 00:44:53,834
DONKEY: Shrek, are you off your nut?

00:44:53,938 --> 00:44:55,496
SHREK: Donkey, keep watch.

00:44:55,606 --> 00:45:04,574
DONKEY: Keep watch? Yeah, Imma keep watch. I’ll watch that wicked witch come and whammy zammy a world of hurt all up your backside. I'm gonna laugh, too. I’ll be giggling to myself.

Donkey walks back the door to stand on guard. Puss climbs up the shelves and stops at a glowing green vial.

00:45:04,748 --> 00:45:06,478
SHREK: What do you see?

00:45:05,748 --> 00:45:07,478
PUSS: "Toad Stool Softener"?

00:45:07,618 --> 00:45:11,611
DONKEY: Oh yeah, right, I’m sure a nice BM is the perfect solution for marital problems!

00:45:11,755 --> 00:45:12,655
PUSS: "Elfa Seltzer"?

00:45:12,755 --> 00:45:13,655
SHREK: Uh-uh.

00:45:13,757 --> 00:45:15,215
PUSS: "Hex Lax"?

00:45:135757 --> 00:45:17,215
SHREK: No! Try "handsome."

00:45:18,195 --> 00:45:19,628
PUSS: Sorry. No handsome.

00:45:20,931 --> 00:45:23,957
PUSS: Hey! How about [[Happily Ever After Potion]]?

00:45:24,068 --> 00:45:26,161
SHREK: Well, what does it do?

00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:29,566
PUSS: It says "Beauty Divine."

00:45:29,673 --> 00:45:34,040
DONKEY: You know in some cultures, donkeys are revered as the wisest of all creatures. Especially us talking ones.

Donkey, not paying attention to the door, doesn't notice a worker and Jerome staring at them.

00:45:34,778 --> 00:45:36,871
SHREK: (gasps) Donkey!

00:45:38,549 --> 00:45:40,414
SHREK: That’ll have to do. We’ve got company!

Puss uses his claw to cut a hole in the glass.

00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:49,220
DONKEY: Can we get on with this?

Puss tries to pull out the [[Happily Ever After potion]], but the hole he made is just too small for it to fit.

00:45:52,563 --> 00:45:54,121
SHREK: Hurry!

Puss tries to force the potion through and the glass starts to crack. It shatters as the bottle is pulled out, sending Puss flying. Donkey manage to catch the falling potion with his mouth.

00:46:02,706 --> 00:46:04,139
SHREK: Nice catch, Donkey!

Puss lands on his feet.

00:46:04,308 --> 00:46:06,208
PUSS: Finally! A good use for your mouth.

An alarm sounds and red lights flash. At the doorway, a metal gate starts to lower down.

00:46:10,714 --> 00:46:11,681
SHREK: Come on!

Shrek grabs Donkey and Puss and diver under the gate. Puss reaches back for his hat just before the gate slams down. A group of elves run in with rapid-fire crossbows and shoot at them. Shrek, still carrying Donkey and Puss, dodges the arrows and jumps onto a conveyer belt. They continue to dodge the arrows as they climb over various wooden machinery. Shrek tips over a giant cauldron, filled with a potion, and the substance spills onto the floor. The elves run away as Shrek jumps up and grabs onto a pulley system that leads back to the entrance. The potion splashes over a cage of two geese and turns them into ballerinas. Two workers are caught in it and are transformed into a [[Animated clock]] and a [[Animated candelabra]] Another group of fleeing elves are turned into doves. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss reach the end of the room and jump onto the catwalk. Later, the potion has dried up and Fairy Godmother shouts at the doves.

00:47:13,444 --> 00:47:18,108
GODMOTHER: I don’t care whose fault it is. Just get this place cleaned up!

00:47:17,108 --> 00:47:19,054
DOVES: Yes, Godmother.

00:47:18,215 --> 00:47:23,084
GODMOTHER: And somebody bring me something deep fried and smothered in chocolate!

Prince Charming comes bursting through the doors behind her.

00:47:24,054 --> 00:47:25,512
CHARMING: Mother!

00:47:27,658 --> 00:47:31,059
GODMOTHER: Charming. Sweetheart. Well This isn’t a good time, pumpkin. Mama’s working.

00:47:31,195 --> 00:47:33,288
CHARMING: Whoa, what happened here?

00:47:33,397 --> 00:47:36,457
GODMOTHER: The ogre, that’s what!

00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:39,058
CHARMING: What?! Where is he, Mom?

Charming pulls his sword out from its sheath and starts swinging it around.

00:47:39,169 --> 00:47:45,535
CHARMING: I shall rend his head from his shoulders! I will smite him where he stands! He will rue the very day he stole my kingdom from me!

Bird poop lands on his shoulder.

00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:52,210
GODMOTHER: Oh, put it away, Junior! You’re still going to be king. We’ll just have to come up with something smarter.

Jerome, who is now a dove, flies over carrying a clipboard.

00:47:53,152 --> 00:47:59,384
JEROME: Pardon. Um…e-everything is accounted for, Fairy Godmother. Except for one potion.

Godmother takes a look at the clipboard.

00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:06,422
GODMOTHER: What? Oh… I do believe we can make this work to our advantage.


Shrek, Donkey, and Puss are walking through a clearing. Shrek reads the label on the potion.

00:48:08,399 --> 00:48:20,096
SHREK: "[[Happily Ever After Potion]]. Maximum strength. For you and your true love. If one of you drinks this, you both will be fine. Happiness, comfort and beauty divine."

00:48:20,577 --> 00:48:22,274
DONKEY: You both will be fine?

00:48:20,577 --> 00:48:24,274
SHREK: I guess it means it’ll affect Fiona, too.

00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:32,978
DONKEY: Hey, man, this don’t feel right. My donkey senses are tingling all over. So why don't you just drop that jug o’ voodoo and let’s get out of here.

00:48:32,156 --> 00:48:35,557
SHREK: It says, "Beauty Divine." How bad can it be?

Shrek sniffs the potion and sneezes mucus onto a mushroom. The mucus is sparkling blue.

00:48:37,628 --> 00:48:45,597
DONKEY: Aha! See, you’re allergic to that stuff. You’re gonna have a reaction. And if you think that I’ll be smearing VapoRub all over your chest, think again!

00:48:45,169 --> 00:48:53,195
PUSS: Boss, just in case there is something wrong with the potion… allow me to take the first sip. It would be an honor to lay my life on the line for you.

00:48:53,844 --> 00:49:01,971
DONKEY: Oh, no, no. I don’t think so. If there's gonna be any animal testing, I’m gonna do it. That’s the ''best'' friend’s job. Now give me that bottle.

Donkey grabs the bottle with his mouth and jugs some of it down. Shrek grabs the bottle.

00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:08,853
SHREK: How do you feel?

00:49:09,726 --> 00:49:13,127
DONKEY: Well I don’t feel any different. I look any different?

00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:15,357
PUSS: You still look like an ass to me.

00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:23,492
SHREK: Maybe it doesn’t work on donkeys. Well, here’s to us, Fiona.

00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,103
DONKEY: Shrek? You drink that, there’s no going back.

00:49:28,211 --> 00:49:29,076
SHREK: I know.

00:49:29,076 --> 00:49:29,211
DONKEY: But, no more wallowing in the mud?

00:49:29,211 --> 00:49:29,840
SHREK: I know.

00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,840
DONKEY: No more itchy butt crack?

00:49:31,979 --> 00:49:32,840
SHREK: I know!

00:49:30,948 --> 00:49:31,314
DONKEY: But you love being an ogre!

00:49:30,948 --> 00:49:33,314
SHREK: ''I know''! (sighs) But I love Fiona more.

00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:42,255
DONKEY: Shrek, no! Wait!

Shrek drinks the rest of the potion. His stomach starts rumbling, and Puss and Donkey take cover behind a fallen log. Shrek lets out a loud fart and the two come out from cover.

00:49:55,038 --> 00:49:59,475
DONKEY: Ooh, got to be… I think you grabbed the "Farty Ever After" potion.

00:49:59,576 --> 00:50:01,339
PUSS: Maybe it’s a dud.

00:50:01,445 --> 00:50:04,440
SHREK: Or maybe Fiona and I were never meant to be.

Suddenly, thunder sounds and gray clouds move in above them.

00:50:08,151 --> 00:50:11,678
DONKEY: Uh-oh. What did I tell you? I think I feel something coming on. I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die!

00:50:15,225 --> 00:50:20,524
DONKEY: Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy. I’m melting! I’m melting!

00:50:20,797 --> 00:50:22,697
SHREK: It’s just the rain, Donkey.

00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,134
DONKEY: (chuckles) Oh.


Shrek looks out from the barn, solemnly starting at Far Far Away way off in the distance. Shrek looks down at Donkey and pats his head.

00:51:07,678 --> 00:51:13,579
DONKEY: Shrek, don’t worry. Things seem bad because it’s dark and rainy and Fiona’s father hired a sleazy hitman to whack you.

Puss hisses at Donkey.

00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:25,420
DONKEY: lt’ll be better in the morning. You’ll see. (singing) The sun’ll come out…tomorrow. (yawns) Bet your bottom…

00:51:25,462 --> 00:51:27,225
SHREK: Bet my bottom?

00:51:27,331 --> 00:51:28,628
DONKEY: I’m coming, Elizabeth!

Donkey rears back and falls to the floor unconscious.

00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,365
SHREK: Donkey? Are you all right?

00:51:32,469 --> 00:51:33,303
PUSS: Hey, boss. Let’s shave him.

00:51:33,469 --> 00:51:36,303
SHREK: D-Donkey?..

Shrek passes out and falls down. Puss screams.


Harold and Lillian are sat by a fireplace when Fiona walks in.

00:51:45,749 --> 00:51:48,115
HAROLD: There you are! We missed you at dinner.

00:51:49,553 --> 00:51:50,986
LILLIAN: What is it, darling?

00:51:52,823 --> 00:51:57,121
FIONA: Dad…I’ve been thinking about what you said. And I’m going to set things right.

00:51:58,161 --> 00:52:00,561
HAROLD: Ah! Excellent! That’s my girl.

00:52:00,664 --> 00:52:09,360
FIONA: It was a mistake to bring Shrek here. I’m going to go out and find him. And then we're gonna go back to the swamp where we belong.

Fiona walks out of the room and grabs her suitcase. Harold and Lillian follow her.

00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:14,372
LILLIAN: Fiona, please!

00:52:14,478 --> 00:52:17,447
HAROLD: Let’s not be rash, darling. You can’t go anywhere right now.

00:52:20,384 --> 00:52:21,544
HAROLD: Fiona...

00:52:20,384 --> 00:52:21,640
LILLIAN: Fiona!

Harold and Lillian run over to Fiona and kneel over her.


Posed similarly, Puss runs over to Shrek and Donkey's unconscious bodies. He lies down beside them.


We see a bright, sparkling purple light emit from the barn. It fades.


Harold and Lillian tend to Fiona, who they have tucked into bed. Lillian walks off, and Harold follows after lingering for a few moments.


A similar bright light flashes in Fiona's room before fading.


Eyes slowly open. Women can be heard whispering.

00:53:01,425 --> 00:53:06,328
MAIDEN #2: Look look look, I told you he was here. Look at him! Look at him!

00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,920
MAIDEN #1: Shh! Quiet!

00:53:01,425 --> 00:53:06,328
MAIDEN #2: Look at him!

Shrek groans. A woman laying down, staring at him, comes into focus.

00:53:08,732 --> 00:53:10,256
JILL: Good morning, sleepyhead.

00:53:11,435 --> 00:53:12,925
JILL & MAIDENS: Good morning!

00:53:13,036 --> 00:53:14,560
MAIDEN #2: We love your kitty!

00:53:14,671 --> 00:53:16,368
SHREK: Oww…my head…

00:53:14,671 --> 00:53:18,368
JILL: Here, I fetched a pail of water.

00:53:18,475 --> 00:53:20,033
SHREK: Thanks.

00:53:20,143 --> 00:53:38,110
SHREK: Oh!.. A cute, button nose? Thick, wavy locks? Taut, round buttocks?! I’m… I’m…

Jill and Maiden #1 latch onto Shrek.

00:53:38,261 --> 00:53:39,558
JILL: Gorgeous!

00:53:38,261 --> 00:53:39,558
MAIDEN #1: I’ll say.

00:53:39,663 --> 00:53:41,324
JILL: I’m Jill. What’s your name?

00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:45,561
SHREK: Um… Shrek.

00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:45,561
JILL: "Shrek"? Wow...are you from Europe?

00:53:45,669 --> 00:53:47,967
MAIDEN #1: You’re so tense!

00:53:45,669 --> 00:53:47,967
JILL: I want to rub his shoulders.

00:53:48,071 --> 00:53:50,801
MAIDEN #1: I got it covered, thanks.

Maiden #2 joins in.

00:53:48,071 --> 00:53:50,801
MAIDEN #2: I don’t have anything to rub!

00:53:50,907 --> 00:53:52,433
JILL: Well, get in line.

00:53:52,542 --> 00:53:55,443
SHREK: Have you ladies seen my donkey?

00:53:52,542 --> 00:53:55,443
DONKEY: Who are you calling donkey?!

Donkey stands in the doorway. He is now a white stallion.

00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,309
SHREK: Donkey? You’re a--

00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:03,309
DONKEY: A stallion, baby! I can whinny! (whinnies) I can count!

Donkey starts to trot around outside.

00:54:04,054 --> 00:54:10,955
DONKEY: Look at me, Shrek! I’m...trotting! That’s some quality potion! What’s in that stuff?

00:54:10,827 --> 00:54:15,990
PUSS: "Oh, don’t take the potion, Mr. Boss, it’s very bad." Pah!

Puss picks up the discarded potion bottle and reads the label.

00:54:15,265 --> 00:54:23,725
PUSS: "Warning: Side effects may include burning, itching, oozing, weeping. Not intended for heart patients or those with… nervous disorders."

00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,600
DONKEY: I’m trotting, I’m trotting in place! Yeah!

Shrek, Puss, and the maidens all stare at Donkey.

00:54:28,712 --> 00:54:29,913
DONKEY: What?

00:54:29,913 --> 00:54:37,542
PUSS: Señor! "To make the effects of this potion permanent, the drinker must obtain his true love’s kiss by midnight."

Shrek grabs the potion to read it for himself.

00:54:37,354 --> 00:54:39,652
SHREK: Midnight?! Why is it always midnight?

00:54:39,756 --> 00:54:42,554
MAIDEN #1: Oh! Pick me! I’ll be your true love!

00:54:39,756 --> 00:54:42,554
JILL: I’ll be your true love.

00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:45,150
MAIDEN #2: I’ll be true!...enough.

00:54:45,328 --> 00:54:48,695
SHREK: Look, ladies, I already have a true love.

00:54:49,933 --> 00:54:54,423
PUSS: And take it from me, Boss. You are going to have one satisfied Princess.

00:54:54,738 --> 00:54:59,332
DONKEY: And let’s face it. You are a lot easier on the eyes. But inside you’re the still same old, mean, salty…

00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:00,878
SHREK: Easy--

00:55:01,978 --> 00:55:03,741
DONKEY: …cantankerous, stinky... …foul, angry ogre you always been.

00:55:03,847 --> 00:55:06,008
SHREK: And you’re still the same annoying donkey.

00:55:06,116 --> 00:55:08,676
DONKEY: Yeah.

00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:14,309
SHREK: Well…look out, princess. Here comes the new me!

Shrek's pants fall down to his ankles. His clothes are much too big for him now.

00:55:15,525 --> 00:55:19,890
DONKEY: First things first, we need to get you out of those clothes.

The women all gasp in excitement.


[[The carriage]] is traveling on a road through the forest. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss are hidden further up the road.

00:55:23,233 --> 00:55:24,825
SHREK: Ready?

00:55:23,233 --> 00:55:24,825
DONKEY: Ready!

[[The carriage]] hits a bump and Donkey screams behind them. A passenger inside the carriage leans out his head.

00:55:28,738 --> 00:55:30,763
NOBLEMAN: Driver, stop!

00:55:30,941 --> 00:55:37,967
DONKEY: Oh, God! Help me, please! My racing days are over! I’m blind! I’m blind! Tell the truth, will I ever play the violin again?

00:55:37,681 --> 00:55:41,376
NOBLEMAN: Oh, you poor creature! Is there ''anything'' I can do for you?

00:55:41,818 --> 00:55:43,979
DONKEY: Well, I guess there is one thing...

00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,055
PUSS: Take off the powdered wig and step away from your drawers!

Shrek puts on [[the nobleman's powdered wig and his clothes]], which are much too small for him.

00:55:51,161 --> 00:55:53,425
PUSS: Not bad.

00:55:51,161 --> 00:55:53,425
DONKEY: Not bad at all.

00:56:01,338 --> 00:56:04,637
NOBLEMANS SON: Father? Is everything all right, Father?

The son gets a look at the scene and tries to hide back inside. Shrek takes his clothes, leaving both the nobleman and his son stranded in their undergarments. Shrek saddles up on Donkey's back with Puss.

00:56:09,946 --> 00:56:17,814
SHREK: Thank you, gentlemen! Someday, I will repay you! Unless, of course, I can't find you or if I forget.


Shrek and Puss are riding Donkey through the streets of Far Far Away. Shrek looks uneasy as people in the streets stop and stare. Shrek cautiously waves at an angry mob, who to his surprise, smile and wave back at him. Shrek admires the new "him" in the mirror and waves at three noblewomen ogling at him. Donkey kicks into a faster pace and towards [[the Far Far Away Palace]].


00:57:01,197 --> 00:57:02,164
GUARD: Halt!

00:57:02,265 --> 00:57:05,723
SHREK: Tell Princess Fiona her husband, Sir Shrek, is here to see her.


Shrek runs inside [[the palace]] to find Fiona. Fiona runs out of her room to do the same. The two almost cross each other's pass.


Shrek runs into Fiona's room and sees a cloaked figure hovering by the window.

00:57:40,036 --> 00:57:41,003
SHREK: Fiona?

The figure takes off the cloak and reveals themselves to be Fairy Godmother.

00:57:44,374 --> 00:57:46,274
GODMOTHER: Hello, handsome.


Fiona runs outside and down the stairs, not recognizing Donkey in his new form.

00:57:48,111 --> 00:57:49,442
FIONA: Shrek!

00:57:49,612 --> 00:57:50,877
DONKEY: Princess!

00:57:50,612 --> 00:57:52,877
FIONA: Donkey?..

00:57:53,016 --> 00:57:55,109
DONKEY: Wow! That potion worked on you too, huh?

00:57:55,251 --> 00:57:56,445
FIONA: What potion?

00:57:56,586 --> 00:58:01,714
DONKEY: Oh its kind of a long story but, see, Shrek and I took some magic potion. And well, now...we’re sexy!

Fiona leans over to see Puss sitting on Donkey's back.

00:58:03,293 --> 00:58:04,351
FIONA: Shrek?..

00:58:08,598 --> 00:58:11,192
PUSS: For you, baby… I could be.

00:58:11,368 --> 00:58:13,598
DONKEY: Yeah, you wish.

00:58:11,368 --> 00:58:13,598
FIONA: Donkey, where is Shrek?

00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:16,000
DONKEY: He just went inside looking for you.


Fiona runs back inside and yells loudly.

00:58:17,907 --> 00:58:18,874
FIONA: Shrek!


00:58:19,843 --> 00:58:22,437
SHREK: Fiona! Fiona!

Shrek runs for the door, but Godmother uses her magic to close it. One of the talking pieces of furniture from before moves in his way.

00:58:24,414 --> 00:58:26,541
FURNITURE: You want to dance, pretty boy?

00:58:29,419 --> 00:58:33,048
GODMOTHER: Are you going so soon? Don’t you want to see your wife?

Godmother gestures to the window and steps aside.


Elsewhere in the palace, Fiona stops at the top of some stairs. She hears a voice come from a room to her right.

00:58:34,457 --> 00:58:35,389
CHARMING: Fiona?

Fiona steps toward the voice and sees Prince Charming standing by a balcony. He is wearing noble clothes that somewhat resemble Shrek's usual getup.

00:58:37,927 --> 00:58:39,087
FIONA: Shrek?

00:58:39,195 --> 00:58:41,993
CHARMING: Aye, Fiona. It is me.

00:58:42,098 --> 00:58:43,759
FIONA: What happened to your voice?

00:58:43,867 --> 00:58:50,963
CHARMING: Uhh...the potion changed a lot of things, Fiona. But not the way I feel about you.

Just as Charming takes Fiona's hand, Harold and Lillian come walking in.

00:58:50,774 --> 00:58:52,207
LILLIAN: Fiona?

00:58:53,109 --> 00:58:54,976
HAROLD: Charming?!

00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:59,810
CHARMING: Ah--do you think so? (laughs) Dad. I was so hoping you would approve.

00:58:59,949 --> 00:59:02,510
LILLIAN: Um… Who are you?

00:59:03,653 --> 00:59:09,054
CHARMING: Mom, it’s me, Shrek. I know you never get a second chance at a first impression, but, well, what do you think?

Charming pulls Fiona in closer, who is still looking at him with suspicion. Neither Harold nor Lillian appear to be approving. Charming hugs Fiona, who hesitantly obliges him. Shrek is shouting from across the other side of the palace in Fiona's room. The glass window muffles his voice and none of them hear him.

00:59:13,897 --> 00:59:16,559
SHREK: Fiona! Fiona!


00:59:20,003 --> 00:59:23,962
SHREK: Fiona! Fiona!

00:59:24,074 --> 00:59:27,566
GODMOTHER: Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho-oh, shoot! I don’t think they can hear us, pigeon.

00:59:30,213 --> 00:59:33,580
GODMOTHER: Don’t you think you’ve already messed her life up enough?

00:59:34,484 --> 00:59:36,509
SHREK: I just wanted her to be happy.

00:59:36,653 --> 00:59:44,951
GODMOTHER: And now she can be. Oh, sweetheart. She’s finally found the prince of her dreams.

00:59:45,061 --> 00:59:49,088
SHREK: But look at me. Look what I’ve done for her.

00:59:49,199 --> 01:00:00,464
GODMOTHER: It’s time you stop living in a fairy tale, Shrek. She’s a princess, and you’re an ogre. That’s something no amount of potion will ever change.

01:00:08,251 --> 01:00:10,082
SHREK: But…I love her.

01:00:11,788 --> 01:00:16,586
GODMOTHER: If you really love her…you’ll let her go.


Shrek comes from out of [[the palace]], angrily barging down the stairs.

01:00:21,664 --> 01:00:22,653
DONKEY: Shrek?

01:00:22,765 --> 01:00:23,823
PUSS: Señor?

01:00:23,933 --> 01:00:26,902
DONKEY: Hey, what’s going on? Where are you going?


Charming and Fiona walk down the hallway away from Harold and Lillian. Fiona looks back and gives Harold a confused look before Charming nudges her closer.

01:00:33,143 --> 01:00:37,546
LILLIAN: You wouldn’t have had anything to do with this...would you, Harold?

Harold looks down with a guilty look on his face.


Shrek walks through the streets with his head bowed down. Donkey and Puss follow him.


Captain Hook is playing the piano and singing. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss are sitting at the bar with their drinks. Doris sets a [[bottle of milk]] on the table.

01:00:52,128 --> 01:00:53,755
DORIS: There you go, boys.

01:00:53,863 --> 01:00:55,797
PUSS: Just leave the bottle, Doris.

01:00:55,899 --> 01:00:58,265
DORIS: Hey. Why the long face?

01:00:59,269 --> 01:01:06,794
SHREK: It was all just a stupid mistake. I never should have rescued her from that tower in the first place.

Puss laps up the milk in his cup and slams it down.

01:01:08,811 --> 01:01:10,676
PUSS: I hate Mondays.

01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:14,409
DONKEY: I can’t believe you’d walk away from the best thing that ever happened to you.

01:01:14,551 --> 01:01:19,075
SHREK: What choice do I have? She loves that pretty boy, Prince Charming.

01:01:19,756 --> 01:01:21,781
DONKEY: Aww, come on. Is he really that good-looking?

01:01:21,925 --> 01:01:27,359
DORIS: Are you kidding? He’s gorgeous! He has a face that looks like it was carved by angels.

01:01:27,764 --> 01:01:30,324
PUSS: Oh. He sounds dreamy.

01:01:30,433 --> 01:01:47,766
SHREK: You know, shockingly, this isn’t making me feel any better. Look, guys. It’s for the best. Mom and Dad approve, and Fiona gets the man she’s always dreamed of. Everybody wins.

01:01:48,484 --> 01:01:53,678
DONKEY: Except for you. I don’t get it, Shrek. You love Fiona.

01:01:53,189 --> 01:01:58,520
SHREK: Aye. And that’s why I have to let her go.

01:01:58,928 --> 01:02:01,897
HAROLD: Umm...excuse me, is she here?

Shrek looks up to see the back of Harold who is talking with Doris.

01:02:01,998 --> 01:02:04,125
DORIS: She’s, uh… in the back.

Harold walks up to a door in the back and sees Fairy Godmother's men from before standing guard.

01:02:05,435 --> 01:02:07,198
HAROLD: Oh, hello again. Heh...


Fairy Godmother and Charming stand waiting inside the room.

01:02:11,474 --> 01:02:13,567
HAROLD: Fairy Godmother. Charming.

01:02:13,676 --> 01:02:17,976
GODMOTHER: Ugh, you’d better have a good reason for dragging us down here, Harold.

01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:23,883
HAROLD: Well, I’m afraid Fiona isn’t really…warming up to Prince Charming.

01:02:23,987 --> 01:02:27,445
CHARMING: Umm, F-Y-I, not my fault.

01:02:23,987 --> 01:02:27,445
GODMOTHER: Oh no, no, of course it’s not, dear.

01:02:27,657 --> 01:02:31,420
CHARMING: I mean, how charming can I be when I have to pretend I’m that dreadful ogre?

01:02:31,995 --> 01:02:37,020
HAROLD: No, no, it’s nobody’s fault. Perhaps it’s best if we just call the whole thing off, okay?

01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:37,867
GODMOTHER & CHARMING: ''What''?!

01:02:38,567 --> 01:02:41,867
HAROLD: I mean you can’t force someone to fall in love!

01:02:41,971 --> 01:02:45,134
GODMOTHER: Oh I beg to differ. I do it all the time.

Fairy Godmother pulls out a red vial and hands it to Harold. Shrek is listening in from the window, outside and out of sight.

01:02:45,241 --> 01:02:51,644
GODMOTHER: Have Fiona drink this and she’ll fall in love with the first man she kisses, which will be Charming.

01:02:52,815 --> 01:02:55,784
HAROLD: Umm… no.

01:02:54,815 --> 01:02:55,784
GODMOTHER: What did you say?

01:02:55,918 --> 01:02:58,284
HAROLD: I...I...I can’t. I...I won’t do it.

01:02:58,388 --> 01:03:07,855
GODMOTHER: Oh, yes, you will. If you remember, I helped you with your happily ever after. And I can take it away just as easily.

Fairy Godmother sticks her wand in Harold's face and it begins to glow.

01:03:07,297 --> 01:03:10,494
GODMOTHER: Is that what you want? Is it?

01:03:11,501 --> 01:03:13,969
HAROLD: No.

01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:23,765
GODMOTHER: Good boy. Now, we have to go. I need to do Charming’s hair before the ball. He’s hopeless. Y'know he’s all high in the front, he can never get to the back. You always need someone to do the back of your hair.

01:03:23,446 --> 01:03:25,073
CHARMING: Oh! Thank you, mother.

01:03:25,181 --> 01:03:26,978
DONKEY: Mother?!

The three look out the window to see Shrek, Donkey, and Puss standing at the window.

01:03:27,116 --> 01:03:30,210
SHREK: Um… Mary! A talking horse!

01:03:30,353 --> 01:03:31,285
GODMOTHER: The ogre!


Outside by the entrance, a pair of guards are interrogating the Headless Horseman. Shrek and Puss ride Donkey and sprint past them. Godmother comes flying after them.

01:03:33,256 --> 01:03:37,192
GODMOTHER: Stop them! Thieves! Bandits! Stop them!


01:03:38,895 --> 01:03:50,864
ANNOUNCER: Well, the abs are fab and it’s gluteus to the maximus here at tonight’s Far, Far Away Royal Ball Blowout! The coaches are lined up as the cream of the crop pours out of them like Miss Muffet’s curds and whey!

01:03:50,406 --> 01:03:59,340
JOAN: Everyone who’s anyone has turned out to honor Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek and, oh my, the outfits look gorgeous! Look! Hansel and Gretel!

[[Hansel and Gretel]] skip down the carpet hand in hand, tossing bread crumbs along their path.

01:04:00,383 --> 01:04:08,112
JOAN: What the heck are the crumbs for? And right behind them, Tom Thumb and Thumbelina! Oh, aren’t they adorable!

The tiny [[Tom Thumb and Thumbelina]] are mistakenly swept up by a man sweeping the crumbs.

01:04:08,124 --> 01:04:11,218
JOAN: Here comes Sleeping Beauty!

The carriage door is opened and [[Sleeping Beauty]] falls onto the carpet, still sleeping.

01:04:11,327 --> 01:04:16,227
JOAN: Oh, tired old thing...who’s this? Who’s this?! Who is this?

[[Fairy Godmother's pink carriage]] descends.

01:04:16,966 --> 01:04:22,094
JOAN: Oh. It’s the one, it’s the only…it’s the Fairy Godmother!

01:04:22,872 --> 01:04:29,069
GODMOTHER: Hello, Far, Far Away! Can I get a "whoop-whoop"?

The crowd whoops.

01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:37,147
GODMOTHER: May all your endings be happy and…well, you know the rest!


[[Pinocchio, Gingy, Wolf, the Three Little Pigs, and the Three Blind Mice]] are using the Magic Mirror as a TV. They are watching footage of the event as it cuts to a commercial break.

01:04:37,453 --> 01:04:40,388
MIRROR: We’ll be right back with the Royal Far Far Away Ball after these messages.

01:04:42,492 --> 01:04:47,084
GINGY: I hate these ball shows! They bore me to tears. Flip over to ''Wheel Of Torture.''

01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:51,025
PINOCCHIO: I’m not flipping anywhere, sir, until I see Shrek and Fiona.

01:04:51,134 --> 01:04:53,762
GINGY: Whizzes on you guys! Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing.

01:04:56,072 --> 01:04:58,267
GINGY: No no, to your left. Your left!

A chicken wing flies up and lands inside the rancid fish bowl.

01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:04,438
MIRROR: Tonight on "K.N.I.G.H.T.S."…

01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:04,438
GINGY: Ah! Now here’s a good show!

Footage plays of Shrek, Donkey, and Puss being chased by several patrols of knights.

01:05:04,547 --> 01:05:07,948
KNIGHT: We got a white bronco heading east into the forest. Requesting backup.

01:05:08,084 --> 01:05:10,109
NARRATOR: It's time for the men in steel to teach these madcap mammals their "devil may mare" attitudes just won't fly!

The chase ends in the streets of Far Far Away. Two knights seize Shrek and three more point their crossbows at him.

SHREK: Alright, alright! Let me go!

Three knights are restraining Donkey.

01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:18,087
DONKEY: Let me go! Why are you grabbing me?! OW!! Police brutality!! POLICE BRUTALITY!!!

01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:18,087
KNIGHT: Come on!

01:05:19,328 --> 01:05:21,319
SHREK: I have to talk to Princess Fiona!

01:05:21,431 --> 01:05:23,456
KNIGHT: We warned you!

A knight runs up to Shrek with pepper shaker and sprays it into his eyes.

01:05:21,431 --> 01:05:23,456
SHREK: Ow! Ow!

01:05:23,566 --> 01:05:26,000
NARRATOR: Will they get away with it? Or did someone let the cat out of the bag?

01:05:26,102 --> 01:05:28,070
PUSS: You capitalist pig dogs!

Puss pounces on a knight who grabs him. Two knights restrain him with an animal capture device and one lifts a [[dime bag]] off of him. He sniffs it and shows the camera.

01:05:33,609 --> 01:05:35,236
KNIGHT: Catnip!

01:05:33,609 --> 01:05:35,236
PUSS: That’s, uh, not mine.

The knights proceed to throw Shrek, Donkey, and Puss into the back of a [[metal wagon]].

01:05:36,379 --> 01:05:38,404
SHREK: Hold on! Alright! Find Princess Fiona!

01:05:38,514 --> 01:05:40,175
DONKEY: I’m a donkey!

The knights shut the doors of the van. Shrek yells through the bars of the door.

01:05:40,316 --> 01:05:42,910
SHREK: Tell her, Shrek--I’m her husband, Shrek! Ow!

The show freezes frame on Shrek's face as a knight sprays him with a pepper shaker again.

NARRATOR: K.N.I.G.H.T.S.!

01:05:44,153 --> 01:05:45,586
GINGY: Quick! Rewind it!

The Mirror rewinds the footage.

01:05:46,622 --> 01:05:49,056
SHREK: Shrek--I’m her husband, Shrek! Ow!

The playback stops. Everyone on the couch sits with their mouths wide open.


Harold is pouring tea into two cups on a tray. He reluctantly pours the contents of the Love Potion into one of the cups. Out from the cup comes a magical dust in the shape of heart, which then dissipates. He pushes open a door, carrying the tray of tea, and sees Fiona staring out of a window.

01:06:16,986 --> 01:06:24,953
HAROLD: Darling? Ah. I thought I might find you here. How about a nice hot cup of tea before the ball?

01:06:25,895 --> 01:06:27,192
FIONA: (sighs) I’m not going.

01:06:27,296 --> 01:06:30,288
HAROLD: But, but, but the...the whole kingdom’s turned out to celebrate your marriage.

01:06:30,399 --> 01:06:34,335
FIONA: There’s just one problem. That’s not my husband. I mean, look at him.

01:06:39,509 --> 01:06:47,976
HAROLD: Yes, he is a bit...different, but people change for the ones they love. You’d be surprised how much I changed for your mother.

01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:51,245
FIONA: ''Change''? He’s completely lost his mind!

01:06:51,654 --> 01:06:58,146
HAROLD: Darling, why not come down to the ball and give him another chance? I mean, you might find you like this new Shrek.

01:06:58,261 --> 01:07:04,424
FIONA: But it’s the old one I fell in love with, Dad. I’d give anything to have him back.

Fiona reaches for one of the [[tea cups]] but Harold quickly grabs it instead.

01:07:07,803 --> 01:07:12,829
HAROLD: Uh, darling. That’s mine. Decaf. O-otherwise I’m up all night.

Fiona takes a sip from the other cup and smiles.

01:07:19,815 --> 01:07:21,407
FIONA: Thanks.

Harold smiles back but looks distressed.


A bridge from the main land connects to an island. On the island is a massive, [[stone prison]] with a giant tower. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss are in a prison cell. Chains dangle from the ceiling which attach to their shackles, keeping them suspended above the floor.

01:07:23,953 --> 01:07:34,418
DONKEY: I gotta get out of here! You can’t lock us up like this! Let me go! Hey, what about my Miranda Rights? You’re supposed to say, I have the right to remain silent.! Nobody said I have the right to remain silent!

01:07:34,964 --> 01:07:40,489
SHREK: Donkey, you ''have'' the right to remain silent! What you lack is the capacity!

01:07:40,269 --> 01:07:43,761
PUSS: I must hold on before I, too, go totally mad.

01:07:43,873 --> 01:07:46,137
PINOCCHIO: Shrek? Donkey?

Staring down from above through a grate is [[Pinocchio, Gingy, Wolf, the Three Little Pigs, and the Three Blind Mice]].

01:07:47,176 --> 01:07:48,575
PUSS: Too late.

01:07:48,744 --> 01:07:51,941
SHREK: Gingy! Pinocchio! Get us out of here!

[[Dynamite]] sticks are rigged to the grate. One of the mice carries the a lit match to light the fuse, but falls through the grate.

01:07:51,081 --> 01:07:52,241
BLIND MOUSE: Oh…

The mouse lands with a thud. The Three Little Pigs shake their heads and light the match themselves.

01:07:55,587 --> 01:07:57,384
LITTLE PIG: Fire in ze hole!

The dynamites' explosion blows off the grate. Pinocchio, with key in hand, jumps and the pigs lowers down by his strings. Pinocchio tangles himself up in his strings after flipping and posing on the way down. Gingy groans and slides down the string.

01:08:18,207 --> 01:08:19,469
GINGY: Look out below!

01:08:21,978 --> 01:08:23,912
SHREK: Quick! Tell a lie!

01:08:24,013 --> 01:08:26,709
PINOCCHIO: What should I say?

01:08:24,013 --> 01:08:26,709
GINGY: Anything, but quick!

01:08:26,882 --> 01:08:29,851
DONKEY: Say something crazy like "I’m wearing ladies’ underwear!"

01:08:29,986 --> 01:08:32,011
PINOCCHIO: I'm...I am wearing ladies’ underwear.

They wait for Pinocchio's nose to grow but nothing happens.

01:08:35,925 --> 01:08:38,519
SHREK: Heh...are you?

01:08:35,925 --> 01:08:38,519
PINOCCHIO: I most certainly am not!

His nose grows a bit.

01:08:39,495 --> 01:08:41,793
DONKEY: It looks like you most certainly am are!

01:08:41,897 --> 01:08:43,421
PINOCCHIO:  I am not!

His nose grows even further.

01:08:41,897 --> 01:08:43,421
PUSS: What kind?

01:08:43,532 --> 01:08:46,092
GINGY: It’s a thong!

Gingy pulls at his [[pink thong]] and lets it slap back.

01:08:43,532 --> 01:08:46,092
PINOCCHIO: Oww! They’re briefs!

Gingy takes the key and runs across Pinocchio's nose as it continues to grow with each denial.

01:08:46,268 --> 01:08:47,565
GINGY: Are not!

01:08:46,268 --> 01:08:47,565
PINOCCHIO: Are too!

01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:49,365
GINGY: Are not!

01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:49,365
PINOCCHIO: Are too!

01:08:49,472 --> 01:08:51,167
GINGY: Here we go. Hang tight!

01:08:54,677 --> 01:08:57,646
DONKEY: Wait, wait, wait! Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey! Ow!

The three are dropped down onto the floor of the cell. Shrek looks out the window, seeing [[the Far Far Away Palace]]. Shrek hears a muffled voice.

01:09:01,651 --> 01:09:03,915
BLIND MOUSE: Excuse me?

01:09:01,651 --> 01:09:03,915
SHREK: What?.. Puss!

01:09:04,053 --> 01:09:06,146
BLIND MOUSE: Pardon me, would you mind letting me go?

Puss spits out the mouse.

01:09:06,288 --> 01:09:07,188
PUSS: Sorry, boss.

01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:10,087
SHREK: Quit messing around! We’ve got to stop that kiss!

01:09:10,192 --> 01:09:12,023
DONKEY: I thought you was going to let her go.

01:09:12,128 --> 01:09:14,392
SHREK: I was, but I can’t let them do this to Fiona!

01:09:14,497 --> 01:09:17,694
DONKEY: Boom! That’s what I like to hear. Look who’s finally coming around!

01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:22,563
PUSS: But it’s impossible! We’ll never get in. The castle is guarded and there is a moat and everything!

01:09:22,738 --> 01:09:28,574
GINGY: Well, folks, it looks like we’re up chocolate creek without a Popsicle stick.

Shrek stares thoughtfully at Gingy.

01:09:32,882 --> 01:09:33,648
GINGY: What?

01:09:33,882 --> 01:09:36,648
SHREK: Do you still know the Muffin Man?

01:09:36,786 --> 01:09:40,222
GINGY: Well, sure! He’s down on Drury Lane. Why?

01:09:40,356 --> 01:09:45,790
SHREK: Because we’re gonna need flour. Lots and lots of flour.


Shrek knocks on the front door of a bakery. The Muffin Man opens the door and happily greets Gingy, who is standing on Shrek's shoulder.

01:09:48,264 --> 01:09:50,698
MUFFIN MAN: Gingy!

01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:55,169
GINGY: Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man! We’ve got a big order to fill!

An evil chuckle is heard from inside [[the bakery]] as lightning strikes in the sky.

01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:01,142
GINGY: It’s alive!


A couple is out on a table drinking tea when their cups begin to shake. In the city, palm trees not too far off fall down one after the other. Donkey comes chasing through with Puss, Pinocchio, Wolf, the Pigs, and the Mice on his back.

01:10:09,385 --> 01:10:13,185
DONKEY: Run, run, run, as fast you can!

01:10:20,429 --> 01:10:22,522
GINGY: Go, baby, go!

01:10:24,066 --> 01:10:27,001
SHREK: There it is, Mongo! To the castle!

Shrek points towards the Far Far Away Palace. Mongo instead grabs a giant coffee mug on top of a [[Farbucks Coffee]] building.

01:10:27,103 --> 01:10:31,472
SHREK: No, you great stupid pastry! Come on!

Customers come running out of the building. Mongo tries to drink from the giant cup, but drops it after nothing comes out of it.

01:10:39,281 --> 01:10:41,943
DONKEY: Mongo! Down here! Look at the pony!

Mongo starts to giggle and follow Donkey.

01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:48,951
DONKEY: That’s right! Follow the pretty pony! Pretty pony wants to play at the castle!

01:10:48,657 --> 01:10:50,284
MONGO: Oooh, pretty pony.


Harold walks with Fiona in arm and gives her off to Prince Charming. An audience gathered out on the ballroom floor cheers as Charming waves.

01:10:51,994 --> 01:10:58,894
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen! Presenting Princess Fiona and her new husband, Prince Shrek!

The crowd applauds and Lillian claps along. Fiona has her hand on Charming's arm as they walk down the steps. Charming continues to wave and blow kisses.

01:11:01,137 --> 01:11:03,264
FIONA: Shrek, what are you doing?

01:11:03,372 --> 01:11:06,569
CHARMING: I’m just playing the part, Fiona.

01:11:06,675 --> 01:11:08,540
FIONA: Is that glitter on your lips?

01:11:08,644 --> 01:11:11,545
CHARMING: Mmm, cherry flavored. Want a taste?

01:11:11,647 --> 01:11:15,447
FIONA: Ugh! What is with you?

01:11:11,647 --> 01:11:15,447
CHARMING: But, Muffin Cake…

Charming shrugs at the Fairy Godmother, who is across the room and by the stage. She goes over to the piano player snapping her fingers.

01:11:18,454 --> 01:11:20,684
GODMOTHER: C minor, put it in C minor.

Godmother addresses the crowd and conjures herself a flashy, red dress.

01:11:21,791 --> 01:11:32,224
GODMOTHER: Ladies and gentlemen. I’d like to dedicate this song to…Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.

A spotlight shines on the two and Fiona stops to look back.

01:11:33,302 --> 01:11:37,031
CHARMING: Fiona, my Princess. Will you honor me with a dance?

01:11:38,274 --> 01:11:45,768
GODMOTHER: Where have all the good men gone / And where are all the gods?

Godmother continutes to sing. Fiona looks uncomfortably at the crowd who are all chanting "Dance! Dance!" . Prince Charming holds out his hand and Fiona eventually takes it. They slowly dance on the ballroom floor.

01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,125
FIONA: Since when do you dance?

01:11:59,228 --> 01:12:05,026
CHARMING: Fiona, my dearest, if there’s one thing I know, it’s that love is full of surprises.

01:12:05,501 --> 01:12:16,026
GODMOTHER: Late at night I toss and I turn / And I dream of what I need...Hit it!

A band and choir join in and the music kicks into gear.


Mongo, Shrek, and Gingy approach the walls surrounding [[the palace]]. Surrounding the walls is a deep moat and the drawbridge over it has been pulled up.

01:12:21,417 --> 01:12:25,410
SHREK: All right, big fella! Let’s crash this party!

01:12:26,889 --> 01:12:28,618
CAPTAIN: Man the catapults! Ready! Fire!

A guard uses a catapult to launch a [[fireball]] right at Mongo's chest,

01:12:32,561 --> 01:12:35,689
SHREK: Brace yourselves!

01:12:32,561 --> 01:12:35,689
MONGO: Ooh! Purty!

The fireball hits him in the chest and he steps back, nearly stomping on Donkey and the rest of the group.

01:12:43,038 --> 01:12:45,268
GINGY: Not the gumdrop button!

01:12:51,714 --> 01:12:53,477
GUARD: Incoming!

01:12:54,683 --> 01:12:56,173
DONKEY: Ha-ha! All right!


Charming and Fiona continue to dance, though she is still uncomfortable. Watching on from the side, Harold is facepalming and Lillian looks at him.


Mongo is getting closer to the gate but the guards are shooting more fireballs at him.

01:13:04,927 --> 01:13:06,554
SHREK: Go, Mongo! Go!

01:13:10,232 --> 01:13:12,427
CAPTAIN: Man the cauldrons!

The guards pour hot, bubbling liquid into a set of machinery,

01:13:17,273 --> 01:13:19,264
SHREK: After you, Mongo.

Mongo starts to pull down the drawbridge.

01:13:22,011 --> 01:13:25,243
SHREK: That’s it! Heave-ho!

The guards pour down a giant vat of the liquid onto Mongo's head.

01:13:27,011 --> 01:13:28,243
SHREK: Watch out!

01:13:29,118 --> 01:13:30,346
DONKEY: Shrek!

Mongo rises back up, the foam having formed around his head like a wig.

01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:36,053
GUARD: More heat, less foam!


Godmother continues to sing. Charming is tossing a rose around his mouth.


Mongo is trying to pull down the drawbridge again.

01:13:47,036 --> 01:13:49,630
SHREK: Heave! Ho!

Shrek looks up as the guards pour down more liquid onto Mongo. This time his arms snap off, still holding open the drawbridge, as the rest of Mongo starts falling back into the moat. Shrek grabs onto one the arms and Gingy jumps back down to Mongo.

01:13:55,477 --> 01:13:58,275
GINGY: Nooo…!

Mongo's arms start to crack as the guards try to pull the drawbridge back up. Shrek climbs up and gets through.


Charming spits out the rose, scoops Fiona in his arms, and leans in for a kiss. Fiona grabs the rose and puts it in her mouth, stopping him. They continue to dance.


Shrek swings down the chain to the drawbridge and knocks over the three guards that were pulling on it. He lowers the drawbridge for the rest of the group.

01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:29,234
SHREK: (whistles) Come on!

The group cheers. Meanwhile, Gingy is standing on Mongo's face as he sinks into the water.

01:14:31,747 --> 01:14:35,410
MONGO: Be...good.

Gingy is scooped up by Puss' sword and into Pinocchio's arms.

01:14:36,819 --> 01:14:37,253
GINGY: He needs me! Let me go!

Shrek and Puss ride Donkey up the deserted red carpet and toward the front doors of [[the palace]]. Suddenly a group of armed guards show up and block the doorway.

01:14:42,725 --> 01:14:44,317
SHREK: Donkey!

Donkey leaps up and over the group of guards and they chase after them. Puss jumps off and Shrek and Donkey halt.

01:14:53,635 --> 01:14:55,034
SHREK: Puss!

01:14:58,107 --> 01:15:00,507
PUSS: Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go!

Donkey and Shrek race off as Puss turns to face the guards. He takes off his hat and sheathes his sword.

01:15:03,312 --> 01:15:05,746
PUSS: Today, I repay my debt.

Puss puts on his cute face. The guards stop and lift the visors from the helmets.

01:15:12,089 --> 01:15:13,319
GUARDS: Aww…

01:15:14,089 --> 01:15:15,319
PUSS: (growling) En garde!

Puss leaps from guard to guard, battling them off with his sword.


Charming once again leans Fiona down in his arms and tries to kiss her. This time she doesn't resist. But just as they are about to kiss, Shrek and Donkey come bursting through the doors to the courtyard.

01:15:26,402 --> 01:15:29,269
SHREK: Stop!

The music comes to a halt. Donkey hurries down the stairs and Shrek jumps off his back.

01:15:33,742 --> 01:15:38,372
SHREK: Hey, you! Back away from my wife!

01:15:38,742 --> 01:15:49,372
FIONA: Shrek?

The crowd gasps. Harold and Lillian look on, surprised.

01:15:39,281 --> 01:15:43,809
GODMOTHER: You couldn’t just go back to your swamp and leave well enough alone.

01:15:43,952 --> 01:15:46,182
SHREK: Now!

The Three Little Pigs launch one of themselves at Godmother using a blanket as a slingshot.

01:15:43,952 --> 01:15:46,182
Three Little Pigs: Pigs und blanket!

The pig grabs onto Godmother's leg and she tries to shake him off. Shrek swings Pinocchio by his strings and throws him at Godmother.

01:15:48,991 --> 01:15:50,458
SHREK: Pinocchio! Get the wand!

01:15:50,592 --> 01:15:52,321
PIG #1: I see London! I see France!

01:15:52,428 --> 01:15:53,725
PINOCCHIO: Waaaahhh!

Pinocchio misses Godmother and she shoots him with her wand, transforming him into a human boy.

01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,464
PINOCCHIO: I’m a real boy!

Godmother flings the pig into the open window of some woman. She raises her wand to zap Shrek, but Wolf begins blowing her away with his breath. She drops [[the wand]] and another pig grabs it and runs. She chases after him.

01:16:07,242 --> 01:16:08,209
DONKEY: Pig!

The pig throws [[the wand]] to Donkey.

01:16:09,511 --> 01:16:10,603
GINGY: Donkey!

Donkey throws it to Gingy as the Fairy Godmother still tries to grab it. Gingy throws it to the Three Blind Mice who don't catch it. [[The wand]] bounces on the ground and activates.

01:16:14,917 --> 01:16:16,350
PINOCCHIO: I’m a real boy. Ah!--

[[The wand]]'s magic hits Pinocchio and he turns back into his puppet self.

01:16:16,485 --> 01:16:17,918
PINOCCHIO: Oh...

Shrek and Godmother chase after [[the wand]].

01:16:21,323 --> 01:16:23,018
GODMOTHER: That’s mine! That’s mine!

Godmother grabs it but Shrek swipes it out of her hands and into the air. Donkey races to [[the wand]]. Puss climbs on top of his head and grabs it.

01:16:27,196 --> 01:16:28,720
DONKEY: Pray for mercy, from Puss!...

01:16:28,897 --> 01:16:30,455
PUSS: And Donkey!

01:16:30,566 --> 01:16:33,501
GODMOTHER: She’s taken the potion! Kiss her now!

Charming runs up to Fiona, grabs her shoulders, and kisses her.

01:16:36,872 --> 01:16:37,839
SHREK: No!

Shrek drops to his knees. Harold and Lillian look on with concern. Godmother smiles. Fiona looks at Charming with surprise, and then with affection. Charming puts his hand on Fiona's face, and then she holds his face with both hands.

01:16:55,524 --> 01:16:57,549
FIONA: Hi-ya!

Fiona headbutts Charming and he drops to the floor. The crowd gasps. Shrek runs up to Fiona.

01:16:59,661 --> 01:17:01,959
SHREK: Fiona.

01:16:59,661 --> 01:17:01,959
FIONA: Shrek.

01:17:02,064 --> 01:17:06,023
GODMOTHER: Harold! You were supposed to give her the potion!

01:17:06,135 --> 01:17:09,969
HAROLD: Well...I guess I gave her the wrong tea.

Charming grabs [[the wand]] from Puss and throws it to Godmother.

01:17:10,139 --> 01:17:10,471
CHARMING: Mummy!

01:17:10,139 --> 01:17:12,471
FIONA: Mummy?

01:17:13,108 --> 01:17:15,838
GODMOTHER: I told you!...

Godmother flies up into the air, clutching onto [[the wand]]. Shrek and Fiona hold onto each other.

01:17:15,944 --> 01:17:20,108
GODMOTHER: Ogres don’t live happily ever after!

Godmother zaps her wand at Shrek and Fiona. Shrek pushes Fiona out of the way and to the ground. Harold runs over to them.

01:17:20,944 --> 01:17:23,108
LILLIAN: Harold!

01:17:22,944 --> 01:17:24,108
FIONA: Shrek!

Harold leaps in front of Shrek and gets hit by [[the wand]]'s zap. Harold's ceremonial armor chestplate bounces the magical trail back to hit Godmother. She is knocked back but appears to be unscathed.

01:17:29,825 --> 01:17:30,757
GODMOTHER: Woo....ha!--

Godmother turns into bubbles. Her glasses and wand drop to the ground. Fiona runs over to Harold's now empty armor and clothes.

01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:45,707
FIONA: (gasping) Oh, Dad!

She sobs and Shrek takes her in his arms. Lillian runs over.

01:17:49,678 --> 01:17:51,509
PINOCCHIO: Is he…?

01:17:49,678 --> 01:17:51,509
GINGY: Yup.

A frog ribbit is heard from inside the chestplate.

01:17:52,948 --> 01:17:54,677
GINGY: He croaked.

A frog comes crawling out from inside the chestplate.

01:17:56,952 --> 01:17:58,112
LILLIAN: Harold?

01:17:58,253 --> 01:17:59,185
FIONA: Dad?

01:18:00,122 --> 01:18:02,488
HAROLD: I’d hoped you’d never see me like this.

01:18:02,591 --> 01:18:04,821
DONKEY: Hey! And he gave you a hard time!

01:18:02,591 --> 01:18:05,821
SHREK: Donkey!

01:18:04,927 --> 01:18:28,122
HAROLD: No, no, he’s right. I’m sorry. To both of you. I only wanted what was best for Fiona. But I can see now… she already has it. Shrek, Fiona…will you accept an old frog’s apologies… and my blessing?

01:18:28,317 --> 01:18:28,547
LILLIAN: Harold?

01:18:30,686 --> 01:18:34,178
HAROLD: I’m sorry, Lillian. I just wish I could be the man you deserve.

Harold tries to leap away but Lillian catches him.

01:18:35,490 --> 01:18:40,618
LILLIAN: You’re more that man today than you ever were… warts and all.

Harold ribbits. The clock chimes.

01:18:44,666 --> 01:18:46,964
PUSS: Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion!

01:18:47,069 --> 01:18:54,161
SHREK: Midnight! Fiona, is this what you want? To be this way forever?

01:18:55,043 --> 01:18:56,706
FIONA: What?

01:18:58,814 --> 01:19:00,406
SHREK: Because if you kiss me now…we can stay like this.

01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:03,441
FIONA: You’d do that? For me?

01:19:03,585 --> 01:19:05,519
SHREK: Yes.

Fiona looks back Lillian and Harold, then back to Shrek.

01:19:14,363 --> 01:19:19,161
FIONA: I want what any princess wants. To live happily ever after…

Shrek leans in to kiss Fiona, but she gently stops him with her hand.

01:19:24,072 --> 01:19:26,700
FIONA: ...with the ogre I married.

01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:32,780
PUSS: Whatever happens, I must not cry! You cannot make me cry!

Puss quietly cries and the clock bells ring.

Shrek and Fiona hold each other's hands as they are engulfed in a magical aura and float into the air. The same happens to Donkey. Donkey begins to transform back into his donkey self.

01:20:00,075 --> 01:20:03,408
DONKEY: No. No, no. Aaah! Ow. Oh, no.

He is lowered back to the ground. So are Shrek and Fiona, who are both now ogres. Donkey sighs.

01:20:24,466 --> 01:20:29,301
SHREK: (laughs) Hey. You still look like a noble steed to me.

01:20:32,741 --> 01:20:36,142
FIONA: (giggles) Now, where were we?

01:20:36,244 --> 01:20:38,542
SHREK: Oh. I remember.

Shrek leans Fiona over and they kiss. The crowd claps.

01:20:45,687 --> 01:20:49,680
PUSS:Hey! Isn’t we supposed to be having a fiesta?

The crowd cheers and Puss and Donkey take to the stage.

01:20:49,825 --> 01:21:00,417
DONKEY: Uno, dos, quatro, hit it! Puss and Donkey, y’all…

Puss and Donkey start singing "Livin' La Vida Loca". The band accompanies them.

01:21:00,202 --> 01:21:05,932
DONKEY: She’s into superstitions / Black cats and voodoo dolls...sing it, Puss!

01:21:05,741 --> 01:21:10,369
PUSS:I feel a premonition / That girl’s gonna make me fall

01:21:12,514 --> 01:21:13,503
DONKEY: Here we go!

The whole crowd is now dancing along.

01:21:13,615 --> 01:21:18,379
PUSS: She’s into new sensations / New kicks in the candlelight

01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:42,614
DONKEY & PUSS: She’s got a new addiction / For every day and night / She’ll make you take your clothes off / And go dancing in the rain / She’ll make you live her crazy life / But she’ll take away your pain / Like a bullet to your brain / Upside inside out / Living la vida loca

Doris walks up to Charming and tries to kiss him.

01:21:44,713 --> 01:21:46,010
DORIS: Hey gorgeous!

Mongo is still fully submerged under the water.

01:21:46,114 --> 01:21:48,708
MONGO: Living la vida loca

01:21:48,850 --> 01:21:59,114
DONKEY & PUSS: Her lips are devil red / And her skin’s the color of mocha / She will wear you out / Living la vida loca

01:21:56,691 --> 01:21:59,353
DONKEY: Oh, she livin’ it loca!

01:21:59,461 --> 01:22:00,860
PUSS: Living la vida loca

01:22:00,962 --> 01:22:04,625
DONKEY: Say it one more time now!

01:22:00,962 --> 01:22:04,625
DONKEY & PUSS: Living la vida loca

01:22:10,005 --> 01:22:13,873
PUSS: Hey, Donkey, that’s Spanish!

01:22:13,975 --> 01:22:50,442
DONKEY & PUSS: She’ll push and pull you down / Living la vida loca / She will wear you out / Living la vida loca / Living la vida loca / She’ll push and pull you down / Living la vida loca / Her lips are devil red / And her skin’s the color of mocha / She will wear you out / Living la vida loca / Living la vida loca / Living la vida loca / Living la vida loca

The song ends and the end credits roll. The dance floor is empty, except for Shrek and Fiona still slow dancing. Donkey sits on the stage quietly singing.

01:24:07,188 --> 01:24:16,447
DONKEY: All by myself / Don’t wanna be / All by myself anymore…

01:24:16,798 --> 01:24:20,323
PUSS: Amigo, we are off to the Kit-Kat Club. Come on, join us.

01:24:20,835 --> 01:24:24,896
DONKEY: Thanks, compadre. I’m… I’m not in the mood.

01:24:25,006 --> 01:24:28,373
PUSS: We will cheer you up! Find you a nice....uh, burro!

A dragon roars. Donkey looks up into the sky.

01:24:30,078 --> 01:24:31,102
DONKEY: Hey, baby! Woo! Hey, that’s my girl! Yeah! All right!

Dragon lands on the dance floor.

01:24:37,719 --> 01:24:38,913
DONKEY: Baby, where you been?

01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:39,913
DRAGON: whimpers

01:24:39,054 --> 01:24:41,284
DONKEY: I’m sorry, too. I should’ve stayed. But Shrek had this thing he had to do  and uh--

01:24:40,192 --> 01:24:42,716
DRAGON: groans

01:24:44,192 --> 01:24:48,716
DONKEY: What? Say it one more time. What you talking about? Are you serious?!

In comes flying a small donkey with the wings, scales, and fiery breath of a dragon.

01:24:55,999 --> 01:24:57,796
DRONKEYS: Da-da!

Five more of the dronkeys come flying in and jump all over Donkey. Dragon blows a cloud in the shape of a heart.

01:24:59,474 --> 01:25:06,738
DONKEY: Look at our little mutant babies! I got to get a job.
